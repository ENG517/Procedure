# Typewriter Procedures

I have created three procedures for typewriter users at various experience levels.

1) How to Load Paper Into a Typewriter
2) How to Set Formatting on a Typewriter
3) How to Replace a Typewriter Ribbon

For each procedure, I introduce the overall task that will be explained. I then list out the materials and steps required to guide them through the process of completing the associated task. I include images and notes for important knowledge needed to complete the task, and things to look out for while they do so. Users are able to obtain new knowledge that they will carry with them as they continue to use their typewriters for years to come.
