# How to Load Paper Into a Typewriter

So, you want to start using a manual typewriter. Whether you plan to write your debut novel, fill out an official document, or just listen the aesthetic sound that is clicking typewriter keys, you will need to first complete one important task: loading the paper!

## Materials

There are minimal materials required to load paper into a typewriter:

 1. A Typewriter
 2. Paper
     - Most manual typewriters can use regular ol' printer paper, though some older models work best with thicker stock paper. It will likely take some trial and error to determine what works best for you.

## Loading the Paper

 1. Remove the existing paper, if applicable
    - Pull back the paper bail to an open position to release its hold on the paper
    - Pull back the paper release lever
    - Roll the platen knob forward until the existing sheet of paper is fully removed
 2. Insert the new paper
    - Manually feed a new sheet of paper downward behind the platen
    - Push the paper release lever back so that it is deactivated
 3. Roll and adjust the new sheet of paper
    - Roll the platen knob forwards, towards the back of the typewriter until the paper begins to come out from under the platen roller
    - Curve the paper backwards so that it is behind the paper bail
 4. Readjust the paper bail
    - Move the paper bail back to a closed position so that it is resting against the paper
 5. Test and Type
    - Use the return lever to move the carriage to the left margin and begin typing
    - If the new sheet of paper seems unstable, unaligned, becomes crinkled, etc. it may not be loaded correctly. Loading paper into a typewriter for the first time can be tricky. Don't worry! Take the time to adjust the paper as needed using the steps above, and practice a few times to get the hang of it. Good luck!
