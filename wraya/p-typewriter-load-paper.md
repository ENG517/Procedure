So, you want to start using a manual typewriter. Whether you plan to write your debut novel, fill out an official document, or just listen the aesthetic sound that is clicking typewriter keys, you will need to first complete one important task: loading the paper!

Loading paper into a typewriter for the first time can be tricky. Don't worry! Take the time to load and adjust your paper as needed using the steps below, and practice a few times to get the hang of it. Good luck!

## Materials

There are minimal materials required to load paper into a typewriter:

 1. A Typewriter
 2. Paper
     - Most manual typewriters can use regular ol' printer paper, though some older models work best with thicker stock paper. It will likely take some trial and error to determine what works best for you.

## Loading the Paper

 1. Locate the important typewriter mechanisms listed below for your typewriter using the image provided. 

     >Note: Your typewriter may look different than the example shown. If this is your first time using a typewriter, it will take some time to fully familiarize yourself with your machine.

    - Paper Bail
    - Paper Release Lever
    - Platen
    - Platen-Knob/Roller-Knob

 2. Remove the existing paper, if applicable
    - Pull back the paper bail to an open position to release its hold on the paper
    - Pull back the paper release lever
    >Note: This is a very important step. While you may be able to pull the paper out without releasing the lever, over time this will damage the paper release mechanism.
    - Roll the platen knob forward until the existing sheet of paper is fully removed
 3. Insert the new paper
    - Manually feed a new sheet of paper downward behind the platen
    - Push the paper release lever back so that it is deactivated
 4. Roll and adjust the new sheet of paper
    - Roll the platen knob forwards, towards the back of the typewriter until the paper begins to come out from under the platen roller
    - Curve the paper backwards so that it is behind the paper bail
 5. Readjust the paper bail
    - Move the paper bail back to a closed position so that it is resting against the paper
 6. Test and Type
    - Use the return lever to move the carriage to the left margin and begin typing
    - If the new sheet of paper seems unstable, misaligned, or becomes crinkled, it may not be loaded correctly. 

## Common Issues To Look Out For

If you are loading paper into a typewriter for the first time and followed all of the steps above but your paper seems to be moving excessively, check for these common problems:

### Paper Release Lever Activation

Double check that the paper release lever is not activated. If it is, simply close it and see if your issues resolve.

### Damaged or Worn Platen

After a few decades or so, platen rollers can become worn and hardened, making their surface very smooth. Try to clean the rollers with a rubber cleaner. This may help roughen the surface enough to go back to normal use. If this does not resolve the issue, the only solution is to have the roller replaced or resurfaced. 

### Damaged Paper Bail

Sometimes, the paper bail or its components may be damaged, resulting in difficulty keeping your paper in place.
- Visually inspect the paper bail bar. If it is bent or misshapen in any way, the paper bail rollers may not be able to make contact with the paper. If this is the case, try to gently bend the bar back into place. If you cannot correct the damage, it may need to be replaced.
- Visually inspect the paper bail rollers. If they are hardened, cracked, or flattened, and are unable to make contact with your paper, they need to be replaced.


### Paper Thickness

As mentioned above, some older typewriters were designed with specific stock paper in mind. 
- If your paper is not staying put, or the rollers are struggling to grip it, consider trying thicker stock paper in place of regular printer paper. 
- If you ARE using thicker paper, and the rollers are struggling to feed the paper, it may be too heavy/thick for the feeding mechanism of your typewriter to handle. Consider using a lower stock paper.
