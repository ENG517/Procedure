# How To Change a Typewriter Ribbon

## Materials

Not much is required to successfully change your typewriters ink ribbon. All you need is:
 1. A Typewriter
 2. A New Ink Ribbon
     - Most typewriters are compatable with universal ribbons. However, it is important to research your typewriter model to ensure a specific ribbon size, spool size, or cassette type is not required. This is particularly important for older models and electric typewriters. 
 3. Gloves (optional)
     - Typewriter ribbons are fully saturated in ink, so handling them can get quite messy. If you prefer to remain ink-stain free, nitrile, latex, or plastic gloves are recommended.
 4. Paper Towels/Cleaning Cloth (optional)
     - Although optional, having something to wipe down excess ink from the work surface and the typewriters interior can be helpful to make this simple task go smoothly!
