# How to Set Formatting on a Typewriter

Many aspects of formatting written text are intuitive on digital word processing software, but may not be as obvious when using a manual typewriter. Don't fret: these formatting tasks are quite simple! Continue reading to learn how to format like a pro.

## Setting Margins

There are two types of margin settings that exist in manual typewriters: visible margins and non-visible, or "Magic" margins.

### Visible Margins

Visible Margins are set with margin stops. These are common on older typewriter models (pre-1950's), Smith-Corona machines, and Brother machines. To set visible margins, follow the steps below:

>Note: It is best to insert your paper before setting your margins, as you may need to use the edge of your paper as a reference.

1. Locate the Margin Stops
    - Margin stops are small metal tabs that allow you to set margins by stopping the carriage at a fixed point, so that you cannot type in the designated margin space. They are typically located on the back or top of the carriage.

2. Center your Carriage
    - Adjust your carriage so that it is centered with the ruler on the typewriter.
     >Note: While centering the carriage is not required, it is best practice as some margin stops can be finicky. It may be difficult to reset your margin stops in the desired location as they may not extend all the way to the left or right with an offset carriage.

3. Move the Margin Stops
    - To move a visible margin stop, press down and slide left or right, using the measurements on your carriage as a guide.
    - Slide the left margin stop to where you want to start typing on your paper, and release pressure from the tab to set it in place.
    - Repeat for the right margin stop, setting it where you want your text to end on your paper.

4. Test your Margins
    - To test the success of this margin setting, slide the carriage between each margin stop. The carriage should halt in movement at each stop.

### Magic Margins

Royal typewriters that were produced after the 1950's are equipped with "Magic Margins." This is a type of non-visible margin function that allows you to automatically set margins at the push of a button, rather than manually setting them using margin stops. To set Magic Margins, follow these steps:

1. Locate your Magic Margin Buttons
    - These are two buttons located on the far ends of the back of your carriage.

2. Move your carriage to where you want to begin typing on the left side in relation to the left edge of your paper, and press the left margin button down.

3. Move your carriage to where you want to stop typing on the right side in relation to the right edge of your paper, and press the right margin button down.

4. If you need to expand your margins, the process is slightly different:
    1. Move your carriage to where your margin is currently set. 
    2. Press down the margin button.
    3. Slide the carriage to where you want the new margin to be.
    4. Release the margin button to set.

5. Test your margins
    - To test the success of this margin setting, slide the carriage left and right. The carriage should halt in movement at your set margin locations.

### Additional Tips

- If you want to continue typing past your margin, most typewriters are equipped with a Margin Release key or lever. This may be denoted by arrows, the letters â€œM-R" or "MAR REL," or something similar. Simply press this key or lever, and the margin stop on the right side will be released and you can continue typing on your current line. This is the case for both visible and non-visible margin settings.
- Most typewriters are equipped with a bell that will ring when you are 5 character spaces away from hitting your right margin. This is so that, when you are typing, you will know if you need to move on to the next line or hyphenate a word at the end of your current line.

## Line Spacing

Manual typewriters allow you to easily adjust the line spacing of your text. More expensive, higher-level typewriters typically have more options for line spacing than older, simpler, or cheaper models. Most commonly, a typewriter will have 2 to 3 options for line spacing. To set line spacing, follow the steps below:

1. Locate your line spacer
    - This is a small lever located on the left hand side of the typewriter, usually right above the carriage return lever.
    - Next to the lever, you will notice some numbering. This numbering corresponds to the pre-set spacing options your machine will have. Typically, a number "1" will correspond to single spacing, "2" will correspond to double spacing, and "3" will correspond to triple spacing. 

2. Shift the lever to the spacing you prefer

3. Test the spacing
    - To ensure you have properly set your desired spacing, type a word or two and hit the carriage return lever to see if your line spacing is set correctly.
