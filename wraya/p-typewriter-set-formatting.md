# How to Set Formatting on a Typewriter

Many aspects of formatting written text are intuitive on digital word processing software, but may not be as obvious when using a manual typewriter. Don't fret: these formatting tasks are quite simple! Continue reading to learn how to format like a pro.

## Setting Margins

There are two types of margin settings that exist in manual typewriters: visible margins and magic margins.

### Visible Margins

Visible Margins are set with margin stops. These are common on older typewriter models (pre-1950's), Smith-Corona machines, and Brother machines. To set visible margins, follow the steps below:

    Note: It is best to insert your paper before setting your margins, as you may need to use the edge of your paper as a benchmark for where you will set your margin stops.

1. Locate the Margin Stops
    - Margin stops are the small, adjustable, metal tabs that allow you to set your margin width. These tabs keep the carriage from moving past the point at which they are set so that you cannot type in the designated margin space. They will be located in different spots on different typewriters, typically on the back or top of your carriage.
        - Note: If you want to continue typing past your margin for any reason, most typewriters are equipped with a Margin Release key or lever. This may look different for each typewriter model, and may be denoted by arrows, the letters “M-R" or "MAR REL," or something similar. Simply press this key or lever, and the right margin stop will be released and you can continue typing on your current line.

2. Center your Carriage
    - Adjust your carriage so that it is centered with the ruler on the typewriter.
        - Note: while centering the carriage is not required, it is best practice as some margin stops can be finicky. It may be difficult to reset your margin stops in the desired location as they may not extend all the way to the left or right with an offset carriage.

3. Move the Margin Stops
    - To move a visible margin stop, press down and slide left or right, using the measurements on your carriage as a guide.
    - Slide the left margin stop to where you want to start typing on your paper, and release pressure from the tab to set it in place.
    - Repeat for the right margin stop, setting it where you want your text to end on your paper.

4. Test your Margins
    - To test the success of this margin setting, slide the carriage between each margin stop. The carriage should halt in movement at each stop.
        - Note: If you want to continue typing past your margin for any reason, most typewriters are equipped with a Margin Release key or lever. This may look different for each typewriter model, and may be denoted by arrows, the letters “M-R" or "MAR REL," or something similar. Simply press this key or lever, and the right margin stop will be released and you can continue typing on your current line.


### Magic Margins

Royal typewriters that were produced after the 1950's are equipped with "Magic Margins." This is a type of margin function that allows you to automatically set margins at the push of a button, rather than manually setting them using margin stops. To set Magic Margins, follow these steps:

### Additional Tips

- Most typewriters are equipped with a bell that will ring when you are 5 character spaces away from hitting your right margin. This is so that, when you are typing, you will know if you need to move on to the next line or hyphenate a word at the end of your current line.
