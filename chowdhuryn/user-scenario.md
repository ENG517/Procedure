# User Scenario 

## **Scenario 1**: 

Mr. Rahman is a 65-year-old man recovering from a mild heart attack. His cardiologist has recommended he use the ECG app for daily heart monitoring. Motivated by following his doctor's digital monitoring protocol and ensuring proper health data management, he wants to set up his app profile correctly and understand the dashboard interface. His goal is to create a comprehensive user profile in the ECG app, configure his medical history and medications, set up automated reminders, and understand how to navigate the app's main dashboard and recording interface. As a new app user with limited digital health experience, he feels overwhelmed by the app's features and needs clear guidance on profile setup, privacy settings, and basic app navigation to build confidence with digital health management.

## **Scenario 2**: 

Mrs. Lopez, age 72, lives alone and is preparing for a scheduled telehealth appointment with her cardiologist. She has been using the ECG monitoring app for several weeks and needs to review her data before the appointment. Motivated by ensuring her doctor has access to comprehensive heart data through their shared patient portal platform, she wants to understand her app-generated reports and trends. Her goal is to navigate to the app's "Health Summary" section, review automated analysis results and trend graphs, generate reports for her doctor, and verify data synchronization with the patient portal. While she is an intermediate app user, she still struggles with interpreting app-generated charts, understanding medical terminology in reports, and confirming successful data sharing through the integrated healthcare platform.

## **Scenario 3**: 

James is a 55-year-old working professional diagnosed with arrhythmia who relies on his ECG monitoring app for daily tracking. One morning, his app displayed multiple "abnormal rhythm" alerts and sync error notifications. Motivated by understanding what these app alerts mean and ensuring continuous data reliability, he needs to manage the alert system effectively. His goal is to access the app's alert history, understand different types of notifications, adjust alert sensitivity settings, troubleshoot sync issues, and know when alerts require medical attention versus app troubleshooting. James is tech-comfortable with apps and systematic about problem-solving, but gets frustrated when app notifications are unclear and worries about missing important health alerts due to technical issues.
