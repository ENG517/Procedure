# Procedure Assignment Reflection

* Write a short analysis (~500 words) in which you explain what you did to meet the assignment's criteria. Use the criteria as headings to structure your reflection.

## How do your procedures address the needs of a "reading to learn to do audience"? Provide some specific examples that connect back to Redish's noted features of such an audience.
* I included explanations for steps and ingredients to expand the users’ task domain, like the ‘About Ingredients’ and ‘Why the long preheat’ sections of the bread procedure. Both provide the reasoning behind the steps, which allows the user to better understand why specific ingredients are requested, and certain steps are important.

* Understanding the ‘why’s of a procedure allows users to better understand he procedure as a whole and learn the ‘how’s, which creates the opportunity for deeper understanding. Rather than just performing the steps, the users are learning as they do, which allows them to learn to do, instead of just one or the other.


## How do your procedures follow the WTGA Staging, Coaching, and Alerting stylistic conventions? Provide some specific examples that connect back to the criteria from Hart-Davidson.
* The introductions to the procedures and the ‘required tools and ingredients’ sections provide clear staging, setting up the goal/success condition (making the thing,) what is required to follow and complete the procedure, and an explanation of how the process involves specific tools. 

* Each step of the recipes are coaching moves, with imperative verbs and clear instructions and details.

  * There are times the recipes don't necessarily follow the 'one action per step' rule, but I chose to do this because I felt making "put the ingredients in the bowl" and "mix the ingredients" read and flowed awkwardly. So instead such steps are combined into "put the ingredients in the bowl and mix"

  * Images provide specific examples of expected results at various stages during the procedure:
    * Ridges/ruffles vs smooth cookies based off of the piping tips used
    * Separating eggs with 3 bowls
    * Stiff peaks
    * Doughballs pulling away from the bowl.
    * Sheeted pasta
    * Bloomed yeast
    * Bread rising 1 inch above the loaf pan

* The alerting moves stand out by being formatted differently than the steps. They're block quotes, bullets, or written in italics in order to catch the reader’s attention.

* Bonus facts are set apart from coaching moves, and differentiated from steps in simliar ways as the alerts.


## How do your procedures follow your task orientation work? In other words, based on your audience and their goals, discuss how you oriented your SCA moves to the tasks.
* The audience goals are to make baked goods and pasta 1) faster, and 2) with a stand mixer in order to make the process easier and faster. The introduction and prerequisites highlight using a stand mixer, and the procedure coaches the users through how to use the stand mixer to knead dough, whip meringue, or sheet pasta.

* The introduction provides staging, and the list of tools and ingredients provides the prerequisites needed before the procedure at can begin. The steps coach the user through the process, broken up with additional details, helpful images, and alerting moves.


## How did you apply a basic docs-as-code editorial workflow to your assignment? Please provide specific cases with screenshots and/or links that can support your claims.
* Everything is written in markdown in VS code, and then peer reviewed with collaborators through Pull Requests. I drafted the layouts and initial steps of the procedures in google docs, then transferred it into VSCode and added images. I made edits and updates through commits. 

* I deleted a few commits, specifically where I had unsuccessfully tried to mass-copy/paste the user scenario.md file so I could have one for each branch, and it caused a strange error. I deleted those copies and that fixed it! Then copied them one-at-a-time, and that way worked.



## How did you apply a consistent use of the Markdown language throughout your project? Please provide specific cases with screenshots and/or links that can support your claims.
* Consistent use of numbered lists and subheadings.

* Included extra facts and alerting moves in block quotes, or as bullet points in numbered lists, to draw attention to them.
