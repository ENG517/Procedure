## User Scenario
"Annaâ€™s grandmother used to make homemade pasta for the family. Now, Anna wants to make homemade pasta herself, but knows from her grandmother that properly rolling out pasta sheets and cutting the noodles is time consuming and difficult to freehand. She wants to ease into the journey of making pasta like her grandmother by using a pasta attachment for her stand mixer."

## Notable Review Requests:
 - The sheeting step gets repetitive. Would like an opinon on using "repeat steps x-y"

 - Decided to include a recipe yield section. Unsure about placement and formatting.

 - Unsure about "1 1/2" vs "1.5"-type formatting for measurements.
 
 - Overall I'm pretty happy with the whole thing, but I'm open to feedback about verbiage and clarity
