## User Scenario

"Hannah started baking bread during the pandemic as a hobby so she could feel productive while isolating. She enjoys having control over the ingredients and flavors, her homemade bread is generally healthier than mass-produced store bread, and she enjoys having fresh, homemade bread every week. Kneading the dough is time consuming and requires a lot of physical effort, and when she injured her wrist she was unable to make bread for two months. Hannah wants to make the whole process easier, and avoid having to take such a long break from baking again, by using a stand mixer to mix and knead the dough for her."

## Notable Review Requests:

- There are a few steps that felt to short to be their own thing, so I combined them with the next short step. Technically it may be doing two things at once, but at the same time dividing "add ingredients to bowl" and "mix ingredients" into two separate steps feels awkward.
- The section about pre-measuring and dividing out the flour. I tried my best to make it clear, but I'm worried it still reads confusingly. Any suggestions about how to rewrite/improve/move it would be appreciated!
