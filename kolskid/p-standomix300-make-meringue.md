### Ingredients
- 4 large eggs
- 1/2 tsp cream of tartar
- 1/8 tsp salt
- 1 cup granulated white sugar
- 1 tsp vanilla extract

## Process

### Prepare!
1. Preheat the oven to 225F
2. Separate the egg whites and yolks. The yolks can be used for a different recipe, or discarded.
   > _**Tip:** Even a small amount of yolk can ruin a meringue. Separate the eggs over a ‘quarantine’ bowl, and then transfer the egg whites to a second ‘collection’ bowl. This way, if a yolk breaks, you won’t lose all the egg whites you’ve already separated._

3. Install the whisk and bowl in the stand mixer.
4. Measure each ingredient and set them out near the stand mixer.
5. Cover a cookie sheet with parchment paper.
6. Set the tip of the piping bag in a tall glass, and turn the excess down over the sides. This will make filling easier!

> **A note before things get rolling:** _Meringue will gradually lose its consistency as it sits around. Because of this, leftover meringue can’t be saved for a second batch of cookies, as it won’t be workable by the time the first batch is done. Plan to bake all of it at once._

### Make the Meringue
1. Wipe down the whisk and bowl with a dry cloth or paper towel, ensuring both are fully dry.
2. Add egg whites, cream of tartar, and salt to the bowl. 
3. Mix on low speed until frothy.	
4. Raise mixer speed to high. 
5. Slowly sprinkle in sugar 1 tbsp at a time, letting each addition fully incorporate before adding more.
6. Add in the vanilla extract.
7. Beat until the mixture is glossy, has a thick, marshmallowy texture, and has increased in volume. It will take several minutes! 
8. When the sugar is fully dissolved and the mixture comes to stiff peaks, it’s ready!
- **Test for dissolved sugar:** Rub a small bit of meringue between your fingers. If it feels gritty, it needs to be mixed longer.
- **Test for stiff peaks:** Unhook the whisk and lift it straight out of the bowl. The meringue should come to a ‘peak’ that is stiff enough to stand upright when the whisk is turned over. If the peak flops over, it needs to be mixed longer.

### Make the Cookies
1. Transfer the meringue to the prepared piping bag.
* Spooning it in with a flexible spatula or dough/bench scraper is easiest, especially with the bag already set up in a glass.
2. Pipe equal(ish)-sized dollops onto the parchment paper about an inch apart. They need room for air circulation, but they will not spread.
3. Place on the center rack of the preheated oven.
4. Bake for 1 hour.
5. Turn the oven off, but do not open the door. The residual heat will gently finish drying the cookies while the oven gradually cools down.
6. Leave the cookies in the off, closed oven for 1-2 hours until they cool completely.
7. Enjoy!
