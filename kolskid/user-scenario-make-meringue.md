# User Scenario - Title Here

**Scenario**: Chris has a small hobby baking business where he sells baked goods to friends, family, coworkers, and neighbors. He is a small-time baker and has only his home kitchen and appliances to make his baked goods. He wants to add meringue cookies to his offerings, but the process to make them by hand is too time consuming and tiring. He recently purchased a stand mixer to more efficiently make his current recipes, and has heard that a stand mixer can handle meringues efficiently and easily.
