# User Scenario - Title Here

**Scenario**: Hannah started baking bread during the pandemic as a hobby so she could feel productive while isolating. She enjoys having control over the ingredients and flavors, her homemade bread is generally healthier than mass-produced store bread, and she enjoys having fresh, homemade bread every week. Kneading the dough is time consuming and requires a lot of physical effort, and when she injured her wrist she was unable to make bread for two months. Hannah wants to make the whole process easier, and avoid having to take such a long break from baking again, by using a stand mixer to mix and knead the dough for her.
