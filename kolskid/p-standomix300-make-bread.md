# How to Make Sandwich Bread

Baking bread is a fun and therapeutic activity with a bonus: you get homemade, fresh bread with no additives, preservatives, or excess sugar. And it’s even easier to make when you don’t have to knead the dough by hand or cover your counters in flour.

## Required tools and ingredients
### Tools
- Stand’o’Mix 300
- Paddle attachment
- Dough hook attachment
- Large bowl
- Oven
- Two loaf pans

### Ingredients
- 2 cups warm water (105-115F)
- 1 Tablespoons active dry yeast
- ¼ cup honey 
- 2 tsp salt
- 2 tbsp neutral oil (canola or vegetable) 
- 5 ½ cups all-purpose or bread flour

 ### *About Ingredients…*

  >*Flour*: For this recipe, bread and all-purpose flour are interchangeable. The only difference is that the extra protein in bread flour will produce a slightly chewier loaf.
  
  >*Yeast*: Active Dry Yeast is not the same as Instant or Rapid Rise yeast. The instructions and time estimates in this recipe are intended for active dry yeast.
  
  >*Oil*: Oils with strong flavors, like olive oil, will affect the taste of the final loaf. Neutral oils will be undetectable and give the best, classic bread flavor.
