# How to Make Sandwich Bread

Baking bread is a fun and therapeutic activity with a bonus: you get homemade, fresh bread with no additives, preservatives, or excess sugar. This beginner-friendly recipe is made even easier with the Stand'o'mix to do the kneading for you.

## Required tools and ingredients
### Tools
- Stand’o’Mix 300
  - Paddle attachment
  - Dough hook attachment
- Large bowl
- Oven
- Two loaf pans

### Ingredients
*Makes 2 loaves*
- 2 Cups warm water (105-115F)
- 1 Tbsp active dry yeast
- ¼ Cup honey 
- 2 Tsp salt
- 2 Tbsp neutral oil (canola or vegetable) 
- 5 ½ Cups all-purpose or bread flour

> ### *About Ingredients…*
 
> - **Flour**: For this recipe, bread and all-purpose flour are interchangeable. The only difference is that the extra protein in bread flour will produce a slightly chewier loaf.  
> - **Yeast**: Active Dry Yeast is not the same as Instant or Rapid Rise yeast, and they all behave differently. The instructions and time estimates in this recipe are intended for active dry yeast.  
> - **Oil**: Oils with strong flavors, like olive oil, will affect the taste of the final loaf. Neutral oils will be undetectable and give the best, classic bread flavor.

## Process

_Don’t forget: Baking is as much art as science! Things like humidity and the temperature of the room will affect the dough in different ways, and no two doughs will be exactly the same. Some might need more water, some might need more flour. Go with the flow, and don't sweat it!_

### Prepare!
1. Install the beater attachment in the mixer.
2. Lightly mix the yeast, water, and a dash of honey in the bowl of the stand mixer and let sit for 5-10 minutes so it can bloom.
   - After 10 minutes the yeast should have a foamy head, like the image below.
   - If it does not have this foam and seems inactive, the yeast is likely dead. check the expiration date on your yeast packets and start over

3. Measure out the salt, oil, and honey while the yeast blooms. 
4. Lightly grease the large bowl with neutral oil
5. Measure and divide the flour into: 3 cups, 1 cup, and the remaining 1½ cup. 
   - The flour will be added in 3 stages, not all at once: first 3 cups, then 1 cup, and then however much more is needed to form a smooth, slightly-tacky dough that pulls away from the sides of the bowl;
   - The exact amount of flour the dough needs will vary depending on the humidity in your kitchen.

### Make the dough
1. Add the measured honey, salt, oil, and 3 cups of flour to the bloomed yeast.   
2. Mix on low until combined.  
3. Switch out the beater for the dough hook, and scrape down the sides of the bowl with a spatula.  
4. Add 1 cup of flour and mix on low until incorporated. 
5. With the mixer running add more flour, ½ cup at a time, until the dough begins to pull away from the sides of the bowl. 
   - Allow each addition to fully incorporate before adding more.
   - The dough should be smooth, elastic, and lightly tacky to the touch. If the dough is sticky, add a little more flour.

6. Raise the mixing speed to medium and let the machine knead the dough for 5 minutes.  


### Rise
1. Transfer the doughball to the oiled bowl, and turn it over once to coat all sides.

2. Take a picture of the doughball, and then cover the bowl with a dish towel or plastic wrap.
3. Leave it in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 ½ hours.
   - The exact time will depend on the temperature of the room. Warmer temperatures mean a faster rise.
   - Compare the dough to your picture to determine when it’s doubled in size.

### Rise Again
1. Generously oil both loaf pans.

2. Punch down the doughball to remove air bubbles.
3. Divide the dough into two equal(ish) portions.
4. Dust a clean area of counter with flour, and lay out one of the halves.
5. Press and stretch the dough into a long, flat rectangle roughly as wide as the loaf pan is long.
   - Don't worry about being too rough or popping air bubbles. Some people use a rolling pin for this step!

6. Roll up the rectangle into a log and place it in one of the loaf pans.

7. Repeat with the other half of the dough.
8. Cover the pans with a dish towel and allow to rise for another 45 minutes – 1 hour, or until they’ve risen about 1 inch above the loaf pan.
9. Preheat the oven to 350 F in the last 20 minutes of the rise.

**Why such a long preheat?**   
_The sensors in your oven only track the temperature of the **air**, a lot of which is going to be lost when you open the door to put the bread in. This results in the oven taking longer to return to temperature at the start of your bake._

_Letting the oven preheat for as long as possible (at least 20 minutes, but the longer the better!) allows the metal interior of the oven, not just the air, to rise to the target temperature, meaning the oven will return to temperature more quickly after you put the bread in._

### Bake 
1. Bake for 30-33 minutes, or until golden brown on top.

   - Testing for doneness: Gently (carefully!) tap the top of a loaf: it should sound hollow.
   - Or, insert an instant-read thermometer into the center of the loaf. The bread is done when it reads 195–200F.
2. Turn the loaves out onto a wire cooling rack and allow to cool at least 10 minutes before slicing.
   - Optional: while the loaves are still hot, brush the tops with butter.
3. Once cool, store in an airtight container or bag for 2–3 days at room temperature, or up to 5 days in the refrigerator.
