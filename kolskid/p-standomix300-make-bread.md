# How to Make Sandwich Bread

Baking bread is a fun and therapeutic activity with a bonus: you get homemade, fresh bread with no additives, preservatives, or excess sugar. And it’s even easier to make when you don’t have to knead the dough by hand or cover your counters in flour.

## Required tools and ingredients
### Tools
- Stand’o’Mix 300
- Paddle attachment
- Dough hook attachment
- Large bowl
- Oven
- Two loaf pans

### Ingredients
- 2 cups warm water (105-115F)
- 1 Tablespoons active dry yeast
- ¼ cup honey 
- 2 tsp salt
- 2 tbsp neutral oil (canola or vegetable) 
- 5 ½ cups all-purpose or bread flour

 ### *About Ingredients…*
 
- **Flour**: For this recipe, bread and all-purpose flour are interchangeable. The only difference is that the extra protein in bread flour will produce a slightly chewier loaf.
  
- **Yeast**: Active Dry Yeast is not the same as Instant or Rapid Rise yeast. The instructions and time estimates in this recipe are intended for active dry yeast.
  
- **Oil**: Oils with strong flavors, like olive oil, will affect the taste of the final loaf. Neutral oils will be undetectable and give the best, classic bread flavor.

## Process

>_Don’t forget: Baking is as much art as science! Things like humidity and the temperature of the room will affect the dough in different ways, and no two doughs will be exactly the same. Don’t sweat it!_

### Prepare!
1. Install the beater attachment in the mixer.
2. Lightly mix the yeast, water, and a dash of honey in the bowl of the stand mixer and let sit for 5-10 minutes so it can bloom.
   - After 10 minutes the yeast should have a foamy head, like the image below.
   - If it does not have this foam and seems inactive, the yeast is likely dead. check the expiration date on your yeast packets to ensure it hasn’t expired and start over.

3. Measure out the salt, oil,  and honey set aside. out the rest of the ingredients while the yeast blooms so everything is ready to go.
4. Lightly grease the large bowl with neutral oil
5. Measure and divide the flour into: 3 cups, 1 cup, and the remaining 1½ cup. 
   - The flour will be added in 3 stages, not all at once: first 3 cups, then 1 cup, and then however much more is needed to form a smooth, slightly-tacky dough that pulls away from the sides of the bowl
   - The exact amount of flour the dough needs will vary depending on the humidity in your kitchen.

### Make the dough
1. Add the measured honey, salt, oil, and 3 cups of flour to the bloomed yeast.
2. Mix on low until combined.
3. Switch out the beater for the dough hook, and scrape down the sides of the bowl with a spatula.
4. Add 1 cup of flour and mix on low until incorporated. 
5. With the mixer running add more flour, ½ cup at a time, until the dough begins to pull away from the sides of the bowl. 
   - Allow each addition to fully incorporate before adding more.
   - The dough should be smooth, elastic, and lightly tacky to the touch. If the dough is sticky, add a little more flour. 
      - Turn off the mixer before you poke the dough, please.
6. Raise the speed to medium and knead the dough for 5 minutes.

### Rise
1. Transfer the doughball to the oiled bowl, turning it over once to coat the doughball.
2. Take a picture of the doughball, and then cover the bowl with a dish towel or plastic wrap.
3. Leave it in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 ½ hours.
- The exact time will depend on the temperature. Warmer temperatures mean a faster rise.
- Compare the dough to your picture to determine when it’s doubled in size.

### Rise Again
1. Generously oil both loaf pans.
2. Punch down the doughball to remove air bubbles.
3. Divide the dough into two equal(ish) portions.
4. Shape each half into logs and place into the greased loaf pans.
5. Cover the pans with a dishtowel, and allow to rise for another 45 minutes - 1 hour, or until they’ve risen about 1 inch above the loaf pan.
6. Preheat the oven to 350 F, either right away or at least 20 minutes before the bread is finished rising.

    > **The importance of a long preheat**: _The sensors in your oven only track the temperature of the **air**, which is going to rush out when you open the door to put the bread in. This results in the oven taking longer to return to temperature at the start of your bake._

   > _Letting the oven preheat for as long as possible (at least 20 minutes, but the longer the better!) allows the metal interior of the oven, not just the air, to rise to the target temperature, meaning the oven will return to temperature more quickly after you put the bread in._

### Bake
1. Bake for 30-33 minutes, or until golden brown on top.
- Testing for doneness: Gently (carefully!) tap the top of a loaf: it should sound hollow.
2. Turn the loaves out onto a wire cooling rack and allow to cool at least 10 minutes before slicing.
- Optional: while the loaves are still hot, brush the tops with butter.
3. Once cool, store in an airtight container or bag for 2-3 days at room temperature, or up to 5 days in the refrigerator.
