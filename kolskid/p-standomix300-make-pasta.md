## Let's Make Pasta!

### Prepare!
1. Measure out the flour and salt, and set out the eggs. 
2. Install the beater in the mixer

###  Make the dough
1. Add the eggs, flour, salt, and 2 tablespoons of water in the stand mixer.
2. Beat on speed 2 until combined (about 30 seconds.)
3. Swithc out the beater for the dough hook.
4. Set to speed 2 and knead for 3 minutes
   - Keep an eye on the mixture. If it looks dry, sprinkle in more water 1 tbsp at a time.
     - Whether or not the dough needs more water will depend on your flour and the humidity in the air. It's not an exact science.
   - The dough should form a ball, pull away from the sides of the bowl, and leave no excess flour in the bowl.

6. Form the dough into a ball with your hands, wrap in plastic wrap, and rest on the counter for 25 minutes.

### Set up the pasta sheeter
1. While the dough rests, attach the pasta sheeter to the mixer. 
2. Turn on the stand mixer and ensure the sheeter is working properly.
3. Set the sheeter to the widest setting: Setting 1. 

### Sheet the pasta
1. Divide dough into 4 equal(ish) portions.
2. Select one portion to work with and re-wrap the other 3. 
   > **Note**: You can decide if you'd rather sheet and cut the whole batch at once, or sheet and cut one portion at a time. This guide does the latter.
3. Flatten the dough until it's about a half-inch thick.
4. Set the stand mixer speed to 2 and carefully feed the dough into the pasta sheeter. 
5. Fold the dough in half, and feed the dough through the sheeter again.
6. Change the sheeter to the next smallest setting (Setting 2.)
7. Lightly sprinkle flour over both sides of the dough to ensure it won't stick.
8. Feed the dough through the sheeter.
9. Fold it in half, and feed it through the sheeter again.
10. Repeat steps 6 - 9 for Setting 3 and 4.
     - If the sheet of pasta gets too long to handle, cut in half or thirds to make it more manageable.
     - Do not go thinner than Setting 4.

### Cut the Noodles
1. Change the sheeting attachment to the cutter, and decide whether you want to cut spaghetti (thinner) or fettucini (wider.)
2. Clear part of the counter or set out a cookie sheet where you can place the finished pasta.
3. Set the mixer on speed 2.
4. Dust the pasta sheets with flour to prevent sticking.
5. Carefully feed one sheet of pasta through the cutter.
