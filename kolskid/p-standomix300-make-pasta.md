# Making Homemade Pasta
Homemade pasta is tastier than storebought, and cooks in half the time. And the stand'o'mix makes the process a breeze: kneading the dough, rolling it out into a nice, even sheet, and even cutting the noodles!

## What You Will Need
### Tools
- Stand’o’Mix 300 stand mixer
   - Beater
   - Dough Hook 
- Pasta sheeter & cutter attachment

### Ingredients
*This recipe yields about 1 - 1 1/2 pounds of pasta, about 8-9 servings.*
- 4 Large Eggs
- 3 ½ Cups All-purpose Flour
- ½ Tsp Salt
- ¼ Cup water 

## Let's Make Pasta!

### Prepare!
1. Measure out the flour, salt, and water, and set out the eggs. 
2. Install the beater in the mixer

###  Make the dough
1. Add the eggs, flour, salt, and 2 tablespoons of water to the stand mixer.
2. Beat on speed 2 until combined (about 30 seconds.)
3. Switch out the beater for the dough hook.
4. Knead for 3 minutes on speed 2.
   - Keep an eye on the mixture. If it looks dry, sprinkle in more water 1 tbsp at a time.
     - Whether or not the dough needs more water will depend on your flour and the humidity in the air. 
   - The dough should form a ball, pull away from the sides of the bowl, and leave no excess flour in the bowl.

6. Remove the finished dough from the mixer and shape into a wide, flat disk (about 1 inch thick) with your hands.
7. Wrap the dough in plastic and rest on the counter for 25 minutes, or up to 1 hour.
   - This rest allows the gluten fibers to relax and become more pliable so the dough can stretch. Don't skip it!

### Set up the pasta sheeter
1. While the dough rests, attach the pasta sheeter to the mixer. 
2. Turn on the stand mixer and ensure the sheeter runs properly.
3. Set the sheeter to the widest setting: Setting 1. 

### Sheet the pasta
1. Divide dough into 4 equal(ish) portions.
2. Select one portion to work with and re-wrap the other 3. 
   > **Note**: It is your choice whether to sheet and cut the whole batch at once, or sheet and cut one portion at a time. This guide does the latter.
3. Flatten the dough until it's about a half-inch thick.
4. Set the stand mixer speed to 2.
5. Lightly sprinkle flour on the dough and and carefully feed it into the pasta sheeter. 
6. Fold the dough in half.
7. Feed the dough through the sheeter two more times.
8. Change the sheeter to the next smallest setting (Setting 2.)
9. Repeat steps 5 - 8 on Setting 2, and again for settings 3, and 4.
     - If the sheet of pasta gets too long to handle, cut in half or thirds.

### Cut the Noodles
1. Change the sheeting attachment to the cutter, and decide whether you want to cut spaghetti (thinner) or fettucini (wider.)
2. Clear part of the counter or set out a cookie sheet where you can place the cut pasta.
3. Set the mixer on speed 2.
4. Dust the pasta sheet with flour to prevent sticking.
5. Carefully feed the sheets of pasta through the cutter, one at a time

6. Dust the cut noodles with additional flour to prevent them sticking together, and gently twist into a loose nest.
7. Allow the noodles to rest and dry on the counter or cookie sheet for 10 minutes before cooking. 

#### Store Additional Pasta
1. Toss pasta with extra flour and allow to dry on the counter for at least 24 hours, or untill fully dry to the touch
   - Exact times will vary depending on the humidity in the room.
2. Store in an airtight container in a dry, dark place for up to 1 month.
