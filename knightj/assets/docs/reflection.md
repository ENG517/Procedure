# Procedure Assignment Reflection

Write a short analysis (~500 words) in which you explain what you did to meet the assignment's criteria. Use the criteria as headings to structure your reflection.

## How do your procedures address the needs of a "reading to learn to do audience"? Provide some specific examples that connect back to Redish's noted features of such an audience.

Because an audience as described by Redish can be easily overwhelmed, I made sure my procedures are succinct and concise while staying detailed enough for all necessary information to be available. This audience is also prone to make errors and have trouble recovering from them, so to help that, in my "How to Build a Swamp Treehouse in Valheim" procedure I included an alerting move in the Prerequisites section letting players know that this procedure was challenging, and it might be better for them to try similar, easier procedures to prepare for this one.

## How do your procedures follow the WTGA Staging, Coaching, and Alerting stylistic conventions? Provide some specific examples that connect back to the criteria from Hart-Davidson.

The procedures I wrote use the WTGA conventions as well as van der Meij and Gellevij’s four components of a procedure. For example, in my procedure, “How to Build a Swamp Treehouse in Valheim,” I provide the goal in the title, the prerequisite states in the Prerequisites section, unwanted states (as defined in the reading) in notes outlining how to complete certain tasks, and actions & reactions screenshots to confirm user actions combined with integrated success statements within some of the steps. Each of my procedures follow the WTGA conventions, with general staging moves at the beginning of each procedure as well as throughout as needed, coaching moves in the steps to reach the goals outlined in the titles, and alerting moves where applicable and made separate from the rest of the procedure to draw readers’ attention.

## How do your procedures follow your task orientation work? In other words, based on your audience and their goals, discuss how you oriented your SCA moves to the tasks.

The task orientation work I did in preparation for writing these procedures was incredibly helpful for this project. For example, in my procedure, “How to Defeat Bonemass in Valheim,” the tasks I identified for the goal were:

- Gather iron from crypts.
- Craft strong weapons and gear.
- Prepare the area around the spawner for the fight.

These three primary tasks guided the coaching and alerting steps, and using them as a framework made the procedure cohesive, relevant, and useful.

## How did you apply a basic docs-as-code editorial workflow to your assignment? Please provide specific cases with screenshots and/or links that can support your claims.

I used GitHub and VS Code to support a docs-as-code workflow. I created and edited content in Markdown using VS Code, and used multiple branches to organize and control my work. I made multiple commits to each branch to create solid backups and provide peer reviewers with segmented work, and used the GitHub extension to see and respond to comments directly in VS Code.

## How did you apply a consistent use of the Markdown language throughout your project? Please provide specific cases with screenshots and/or links that can support your claims.

I found that because Markdown is such a simple language, it was easy to get into a consistent workflow using it. I tended to have levels 1-2 headings, except for one procedure where I have three level 3 headings because that made sense for that procedure. I used level 2 headings to break up the major sections, and used ordered lists to sequence the coaching moves. I used a “>” character to create a quote block, which I used in conjunction with bold and italic characters to highlight alerting events. I also used quote blocks to provide captions for images.
