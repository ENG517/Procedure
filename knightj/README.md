# Jacob Knight's Unit 1 Project Procedures

Following the guidelines covered in class, here are 3 procedures that help users of differing skill and experience levels achieve their goals of defeating Bonemass, taming animals, and building a swamp treehouse.

Also included are the user scenarios used to guide the development of these procedures, and a reflection analyzing how my procedures use principles and techniques discussed in Unit 1 of this class.
