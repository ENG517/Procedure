## About Bonemass

Bonemass reigns over the Swamp biome and is the third boss you'll encounter in Valheim. Due to the steep learning curve between the Black Forest and the Swamp, you may be apprehensive about taking on the poisonous mass. With this guide, you will be well equipped to take it down and continue your viking journey.

## Prerequisites

While you can go virtually anywhere in Valheim at any time, there are some things you should do first if you want to be successful at defeating Bonemass:

- Defeat both Eikthyr and the Elder
- Have either level three troll armor or level three bronze armor
- Have bronze-tier weaponry
- Locate the Bonemass spawner.

## Preparing to Defeat Bonemass

To be fully prepared to defeat Bonemass, follow these steps:

1. Gather at least 150 pieces of raw iron.
    1. Head to a Swamp biome area.
    2. Find a crypt. They look like this:

    >*A crypt, where you can find iron and other treasures*

    3. Using the crypt key you obtained from defeating the Elder, open the crypt and head inside.
    4. Using your pickaxe, break apart the iron veins to get raw iron.
        >*Don't forget to check the chests you find in the crypt, they often have lots of raw iron inside.*
2. Craft all three iron armor pieces, an iron mace, and an iron shield. 
    - Upgrade these as much as you can - level three is ideal, but you can get by with level two.
3. Craft swamp-tier foods and several (at least five) poison resistance meads.
4. Build a portal at your base with the name "bonemass".
5. Collect 10 withered bones from crypts.
6. Prepare a large area around the Bonemass spawner with your hoe and pickaxe, removing water and shrubs so you have plenty of space for the fight.
7. Build a portal nearby with the name "bonemass" so you can get back quickly if you die in the fight.
8. Once you feel ready, summon Bonemass with the withered bones.

Now you are well prepared to defeat Bonemass and continue your quest to earn a place in Valhalla. Sk√•l!
