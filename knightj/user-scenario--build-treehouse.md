# User Scenario - How to Build a Swamp Treehouse

**Scenario**: An intermediate-level Valheim player, Luca, has defeated all of the bosses and is now interested in doing more base building and creating interesting structures. He is interested in building in the swamp, but he can’t think of styles in the swamp that will feel especially unique and fun compared to other biomes. He’s heard one can build treehouses in the swamp but doesn’t know how.
