# Wiring a Single-Humbucker Setup: Connecting Components

## Prerequisites

### Materials

* One Humbucker
* Two Split Shaft 500K potentiometers
  * The larger the casing the easier they are to work with.
* Potentiometer knobs
* A mono output jack
* A spool of red and a spool of black stranded tinned copper wire
  * You can find single spools that have both.
* A spool of solid core copper wire
* A .022uf tone capacitor

Your materials should be prepped and ready to connect. If they are not, follow the [Wiring a Single-Humbucker Setup: Preparing Materials](/hassell/p-guitar-wiring-prep-materials.md) guide.


### Tools

* Soldering Iron, between 40W and 80W. Anything less than 40W will be too weak.
* Solder; any kind will work.
* A wire stripper
* A screwdriver set
* Electrical tape
* A marker

### Skills

* You should have some prior experience soldering. If you don't, practice for a few hours before continuing with this guide. *(Will insert link to a soldering guide here)*

## Connecting the Humbucker

![Wiring diagram showing where to connect humbucker wires](/hassell/assets/images/screenshots/humbucker-wire.png)

### 1. Connect the Hot Wire

Solder the **black** wire to **Lug 3** of your designated volume pot.

### 2. Connect the Ground Wire

Solder the **white**, **green**, or **yellow** wire, depending on the type and brand of your humbucker, to the casing of the volume pot.

## Connecting the Hot Wires

### 1. Join Hot Wires

Twist together the stripped ends of the two red wires you previously cut on one side only, leaving the other ends separate.

### 2. Solder Hot Wires

1. Solder the twisted end to **Lug 2** of the volume pot.
2. Solder one of the separate ends to **Lug 1** of the tone pot.
3. Solder the other separate end to the **Tip** of the output jack (smaller outer-most lug).

## Connecting the Capacitor

### 1. Connect Hot End

Solder one leg of the capacitor to **Lug 2** of the tone pot. Since this kind of capacitor is non-polarized, meaning current can flow in either direction, it does not matter which end you choose to be the hot end.

### 2. Connect Ground End

![Diagram showing the tone pot side view with parallel capacitor leg](/hassell/assets/images/screenshots/tone-pot-side-view.png)

1. Place the other leg of the capacitor against the tone pot case and fold the end to be parallel with the pot casing.
2. Solder the folded end to the pot casing.

## Grounding Lug 1 of the Volume Pot

![Wiring diagram showing the ground connection from Lug 1 of the volume pot to the casing](/hassell/assets/images/screenshots/lug1-ground.png)

### Method 1: Connect the Solid Core Wire

Solder the fully-stripped 0.5 inch solid core wire from **Lug 1** of the volume pot straight back to the volume pot casing.

> **Note:** Depending on the size of the pots you have, 0.5 inches may be too large. If the wire is too large, you again risk breakage or a cold solder connection that will nullify the grounding.

### Method 2: Solder the Lug Directly

Instead of using a solid core wire, you can bend **Lug 1** of the volume pot back and solder it directly to the casing, which is far more time and space efficient.

**I do not recommend using this unless you are confident in your soldering abilities.**
