# Wiring a Single-Humbucker Setup: Connecting Components

## Prerequisites

### Materials

* One Humbucker
* Two Split Shaft 500K potentiometers
  * The larger the casing the easier they are to work with.
* Potentiometer knobs
* A mono output jack
* A spool of red and a spool of black stranded tinned copper wire
  * You can find single spools that have both.
* A spool of solid core copper wire
* A .022uf tone capacitor

Your materials should be prepped and ready to connect. If they are not, follow the [Wiring a Single-Humbucker Setup: Preparing Materials](/hassell/p-guitar-wiring-prep-materials.md) guide.


### Tools

* Soldering Iron, between 40W and 80W. Anything less than 40W will be too weak.
* Solder; any kind will work.
* A wire stripper
* A screwdriver set
* Electrical tape
* A marker

### Skills

* You should have some prior experience soldering. If you don't, practice for a few hours before continuing with this guide. *(Will insert link to a soldering guide here)*

## Connecting the Humbucker

![Wiring diagram showing where to connect humbucker wires](/hassell/assets/images/screenshots/humbucker-wire.png)

### 1. Connect the Hot Wire

Solder the **black** wire to **Lug 3** of your designated volume pot.

### 2. Connect the Ground Wire

Solder the **white**, **green**, or **yellow** wire, depending on the type and brand of your humbucker, to the casing of the volume pot.

## Connecting the Hot Wires

### 1. Join Hot Wires

Twist together the stripped ends of the two red wires you previously cut on one side only, leaving the other ends separate.

### 2. Solder Hot Wires

1. Solder the twisted end to **Lug 2** of the volume pot.
2. Solder one of the separate ends to **Lug 1** of the tone pot.
3. Solder the other separate end to the **Tip** of the output jack (smaller outer-most lug).
