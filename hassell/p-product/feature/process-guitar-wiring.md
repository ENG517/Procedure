# Introduction to Electric Guitar Wiring: a Single-Humbucker Setup

## Prerequisites

### Materials

* One Humbucker
* Two Split Shaft 500K potentiometers
  * The larger the casing the easier they are to work with.
* Potentiometer knobs
* A mono output jack
* A spool of red and a spool of black stranded tinned copper wire
  * You can find single spools that have both.
* A .022uf tone capacitor

### Tools

* Soldering Iron, between 40W and 80W. Anything less than 40W will be too weak.
* Solder; any kind will work.
* A screwdriver set

### Skills

You should have some prior experience soldering. If you don't, practice for a few hours before continuing with this guide. *(Will insert link to a soldering guide here)*
