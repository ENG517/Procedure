# Introduction to Electric Guitar Wiring: a Single-Humbucker Setup

## Prerequisites

### Materials

* One Humbucker
* Two Split Shaft 500K potentiometers
  * The larger the casing the easier they are to work with.
* Potentiometer knobs
* A mono output jack
* A spool of red and a spool of black stranded tinned copper wire
  * You can find single spools that have both.
* A .022uf tone capacitor

### Tools

* Soldering Iron, between 40W and 80W. Anything less than 40W will be too weak.
* Solder; any kind will work.
* A screwdriver set

### Skills

You should have some prior experience soldering. If you don't, practice for a few hours before continuing with this guide. *(Will insert link to a soldering guide here)*

## Breakdown of Potentiometers

![Potentiometer diagram](/hassell/assets/images/screenshots/potentiometer-diagram.png)

A *potentiometer* (which I'll refer to as a "pot" from now on) is a type of rotating resistor that, for our purposes, will control your guitar's *tone* and *volume* (hence why you need two). They are what you will be soldering on, so it's important to get acquainted with their parts.

### Lugs

* Lug 2 is connected to the carbon track, a type of resistant wiper (think windshield) that controls the amount of electrical current diverted to the outer lugs (Lugs 1 and 3). Turning the knob left will divert the current to Lug 1 while turning the knob right will divert the current to Lug 3.
* Lugs 1 and 3 will serve different functions across the volume and tone pots, so the important thing to remember is one will receive current and one will not.
