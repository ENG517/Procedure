# User Scenario 

## Scenario

Mrs. Lopez, age 72, lives alone and is preparing for a scheduled telehealth appointment with her cardiologist. She has been using the ECG monitoring app for several weeks and needs to review her data before the appointment. Motivated by ensuring her doctor has access to comprehensive heart data through their shared patient portal platform, she wants to understand her app-generated reports and trends. Her goal is to navigate to the app's "Health Summary" section, review automated analysis results and trend graphs, generate reports for her doctor, and verify data synchronization with the patient portal. While she is an intermediate app user, she still struggles with interpreting app-generated charts, understanding medical terminology in reports, and confirming successful data sharing through the integrated healthcare platform.
