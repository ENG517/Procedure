# User Scenario 

**Scenario** 

Mr. Rahman is a 65-year-old man recovering from a mild heart attack. His cardiologist has recommended he use the ECG app for daily heart monitoring. Motivated by following his doctor's digital monitoring protocol and ensuring proper health data management, he wants to set up his app profile correctly and understand the dashboard interface. His goal is to create a comprehensive user profile in the ECG app, configure his medical history and medications, set up automated reminders, and understand how to navigate the app's main dashboard and recording interface. As a new app user with limited digital health experience, he feels overwhelmed by the app's features and needs clear guidance on profile setup, privacy settings, and basic app navigation to build confidence with digital health management.
