# User Scenario 

## Scenario

Mrs. Lopez, age 72, lives alone and has a scheduled telehealth appointment with her cardiologist. She has been consistently using the Kardia ECG app for several weeks and needs to prepare her monitoring data for the appointment. Her doctor has requested that she bring comprehensive ECG reports covering the last 30 days.
Her goal is to navigate to her Kardia app's History section, locate her ECG recordings and trends, generate a comprehensive PDF report for the specified date range, and successfully email it to both herself and her doctor before the appointment. While she has become comfortable with basic app use, Mrs. Lopez still feels uncertain about finding the right sections in the app, selecting the correct date ranges for reports, and ensuring the PDF generates properly with all her ECG data included.
She needs clear guidance on accessing her ECG history, generating the appropriate reports her doctor expects, and confirming the report contains complete information for her telehealth consultation.
