# User Scenario 

## **Scenario 1**

Mr. Rahman is a 65-year-old retired teacher recovering from a mild heart attack. His cardiologist has prescribed daily ECG monitoring using the Kardia app. Having only learned basic computer skills after retirement, Mr. Rahman feels anxious about setting up medical apps correctly, particularly when handling his health data.
His goal is to successfully create his Kardia account, verify his email, and complete the basic profile setup with his medical information and medications. Mr. Rahman's main concerns include creating a secure account, entering medical information accurately for reliable readings, and not missing critical setup steps. He needs clear, step-by-step guidance that acknowledges his limited digital health experience while building his confidence in using the app for his prescribed monitoring routine.

## **Scenario 2**

Mrs. Lopez, age 72, lives alone and has a scheduled telehealth appointment with her cardiologist. She has been consistently using the Kardia ECG app for several weeks and needs to prepare her monitoring data for the appointment. Her doctor has requested that she bring comprehensive ECG reports covering the last 30 days.
Her goal is to navigate to her Kardia app's History section, locate her ECG recordings and trends, generate a comprehensive PDF report for the specified date range, and successfully email it to both herself and her doctor before the appointment. While she has become comfortable with basic app use, Mrs. Lopez still feels uncertain about finding the right sections in the app, selecting the correct date ranges for reports, and ensuring the PDF generates properly with all her ECG data included.
She needs clear guidance on accessing her ECG history, generating the appropriate reports her doctor expects, and confirming the report contains complete information for her telehealth consultation.

## **Scenario 3**

James is a 55-year-old working professional diagnosed with arrhythmia who relies on his ECG monitoring app for daily tracking. One morning, his app displayed multiple "abnormal rhythm" alerts and sync error notifications. Motivated by understanding what these app alerts mean and ensuring continuous data reliability, he needs to manage the alert system effectively. His goal is to access the app's alert history, understand different types of notifications, troubleshoot sync issues, and know when alerts require medical attention versus app troubleshooting. James is tech-comfortable with apps and systematic about problem-solving, but gets frustrated when app notifications are unclear and worries about missing important health alerts due to technical issues.
