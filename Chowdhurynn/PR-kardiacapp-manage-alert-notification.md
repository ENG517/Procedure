    - Created new procedure: `p-p-kardiacapp-manage-alert-notifications`
    - Procedure's Goal: Understand and manage ECG app alerts while troubleshooting technical issues 

## User Scenario

James is a 55-year-old working professional diagnosed with arrhythmia who relies on his ECG monitoring app for daily tracking. One morning, his app displayed multiple "abnormal rhythm" alerts and sync error notifications. Motivated by understanding what these app alerts mean and ensuring continuous data reliability, he needs to manage the alert system effectively. His goal is to access the app's alert history, understand different types of notifications, troubleshoot sync issues, and know when alerts require medical attention versus app troubleshooting. James is tech-comfortable with apps and systematic about problem-solving, but gets frustrated when app notifications are unclear and worries about missing important health alerts due to technical issues.
