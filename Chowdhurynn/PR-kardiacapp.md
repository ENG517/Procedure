    - Procedure's Goal: Setting up comprehensive ECG app profile.

## User Scenario

Mr. Rahman is a 65-year-old retired teacher recovering from a mild heart attack. His cardiologist has prescribed daily ECG monitoring using the Kardia app. Having only learned basic computer skills after retirement, Mr. Rahman feels anxious about setting up medical apps correctly, particularly when handling his health data.
His goal is to successfully create his Kardia account, verify his email, and complete the basic profile setup with his medical information and medications. Mr. Rahman's main concerns include creating a secure account, entering medical information accurately for reliable readings, and not missing critical setup steps. He needs clear, step-by-step guidance that acknowledges his limited digital health experience while building his confidence in using the app for his prescribed monitoring routine.
