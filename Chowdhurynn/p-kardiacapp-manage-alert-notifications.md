# Managing Kardia ECG App Alerts and Notifications

Your Kardia ECG app not only records your heart rhythms but also generates alerts and notifications that guide your next steps. These alerts can confirm normal readings, flag rhythm concerns that may need medical review, or warn about technical issues like sync errors.

## The goal of this guide is to help you:

- Interpret instant analysis results and understand what different alerts mean.
- Review your alert history and troubleshoot common issues such as sync errors.
- Decide when to manage alerts within the app and when to contact your doctor or seek emergency care.

> **Who can use this guide?**
>
> Anyone with an active Kardia app account who receives ECG analysis results and notifications can use these instructions. You should already have at least one recorded ECG to access your analysis history and manage alerts.
