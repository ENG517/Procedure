# User Scenario 1 - First-Time Installer

**Scenario**: "Alyssa and Kaiya are college roommates in their early 20s. They need to set up a Wi-Fi router to get internet access for their school and work devices, but neither of them have ever installed one before and they don't have a lot of experience with installing hardware or with the terminology used to describe Wi-Fi routers. They just purchased a Synology WRX560 router and want quick, simple instructions."

# User Scenario 2 - First-Time Replacer, Experienced Installer

**Scenario**: "Brittany is a wife and mother in her mid-30s who needs to replace her old Synology WRX560 Wi-Fi router with a new one due to some connectivity issues and slow service. She's familiar with the installation process, but is unsure how to safely and correctly uninstall her router and replace it with the new one. Her goal is to get through the replacement process as quickly and smoothly as possible so she can restore her family's Wi-Fi connection ASAP."

# User Scenario 3 - Experienced User, Beginner at Troubleshooting

**Scenario**: "Pam and Gray are an elderly married couple in their late 60s who are having connectivity/speed issues with their Synology WRX560 Wi-Fi router. Although they're very familiar with the installation and set-up process, they have no experience with troubleshooting and are unsure where to even start. They want to resolve the issue as quickly and efficiently as possible, and are also hoping to remember this information in case of future issues. They're also looking for a guide free of complex language since they aren't very familiar with technological terms, although they do know the terms for the different parts of their router setup."
