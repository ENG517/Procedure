# User Scenario - First-Time Installer

**Scenario**: "Alyssa and Kaiya are college roommates in their early 20s. They need to set up a Wi-Fi router to get internet access for their school and work devices, but neither of them have ever installed one before and they don't have a lot of experience with installing hardware or with the terminology used to describe Wi-Fi routers. They just purchased a Synology WRX560 router and want quick, simple instructions."
