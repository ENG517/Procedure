# Procedure 2 - Replacing a Wi-Fi Router

I began my second procedure, which is for medium-level users who want to replace their old Synology WRX560 Wi-Fi router with a new one. 


**Completed Work**
- Started on my second procedure: 'replacewifirouter' 
- Procedure's goal: To successfully uninstall an old Synology WRX560 Wi-Fi router and replace it with a new one. 
- I laid out the basic sections with headers, added some text and an image (I may look for a second one later), and made an empty numbered list for my steps to go into. 


# User Scenario - Experienced Installer, First-Time Replacer

**Scenario**: "Brittany is a wife and mother in her mid-30s. She wants to replace her old Synology WRX560 with a new one because the old one is beginning to slow down and can't keep up with her family's internet needs. She's experienced with the installation process, but not with the replacement process, and wants a helpful guide on how to switch out the old router for the new one as quickly and smoothly as possible."


## Notable Review Requests
- I tried to make the introduction more user-focused by using "your"; i.e. "your Wi-Fi router" instead of "a Wi-Fi router". Does this work better? If so, I'll change my first procedure to adopt this as well. 
- Because this procedure is for a slightly more advanced audience than the previous (with the intended user being someone who has installed a Synology router in the past), I didn't include a "terms to know" section or any subsections of the steps. Does this feel like a good match for the intended audience, or does it feel too difficult/complex? 
- Same questions of quality as before; is the intro too quick, how does the layout look? I'm still a little limited on photos but hoping to find more when I get more time to work on this.
