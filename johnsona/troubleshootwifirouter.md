If your Synology WRX560 router is acting up and you're not sure how to fix it, this guide is for you! We'll walk you through the various troubleshooting methods and help you quickly fix any issues you're facing with your router. 

What you'll need will depend on which method ends up working for you, but generally speaking, make sure you have a fully-installed router and a device you can access the Internet through. You'll also need to actually be in the room with your router, since some of these methods involve physically checking or moving it.

## The Troubleshooting Methods

### Alternative Solutions

Sometimes, the problem isn't with your Synology router at all! Before using the other troubleshooting methods, consider the following steps. 

1. Check that your device is logged into the right network with the correct password. 

2. Try accessing multiple websites on different devices to make sure that the issue isn't just with one specific website. 

3. Check for local outages or technical difficulties Synology may be experiencing. This could be impacting your router's ability to work properly. 

### Router Resets

Resetting the router may seem too easy, but it can actually be an effective fix for many issues, including spotty signal and slow service!

1. Unplug the power cords of your router and modem.

2. Wait for up to one minute, then plug them back in. 

3. Check your device's connection to see if the issue has been resolved. 

### Physical Issues

If resetting your router doesn't work, there may be some physical issues, such as a faulty power source, hardware damage, or the router being in the wrong environment. 

1. Check that the power outlet for your router is working properly. You can do this by plugging a different device into the same outlet and checking that it's charging. 
> **Note:** If the router's indicator lights are off, it could be a sign that the outlet or the power cord aren't working. 

2. Inspect the router, modem and cables for signs of physical damage. This can include tears or kinks in cables, dust build-up in the router vent, and cracks or dents in the router or modem. 
> **Note:** If there's a dust build-up in your router vents, you can try removing it with compressed air or a cotton swab. If any of the hardware is damaged, the best thing to do is replace it!

3. Check the placement of your router. If your router isn't in a central location, is too close to other sources of electricity, or is obstructed by materials like concrete or metal, it may need to be moved to receive a better connection. 
> **Note:** It also helps to put your router in a cool area where it isn't being hit by sunlight. This helps reduce over-heating and dust build-up!

4. Check your device's connection to see if the issue has been resolved. 

### Software Updates

No physical issues? Maybe your software needs to be updated!

1. Visit [Synology's official website](https://www.synology.com/en-us) to see if new software has been released. 

2. Download the newest version of the software to your device. 

3. Log into your network administrator account for your router. 
> **Note:** Your network administrator account is the account you made after installing your router. It's used for logging into your Synology network. 

4. Navigate to the 'Firmware Update' section and upload the new file.
> **Note:** Do _not_ interrupt this new update; it could severely damage your router. 

5. Restart your router. 

6. Check your device's connection to see if the issue has been resolved. 

### Settings Adjustments

If nothing has worked so far, it might be best to look at your router's settings and see if something needs to be changed!

1. Log into your network administrator account on a device to review your settings.

2. Check that DHCP server function is enabled. 

3. Clear your cache or use the Flush DNS option. 

4. Reboot your router by clicking 'Reboot'.
