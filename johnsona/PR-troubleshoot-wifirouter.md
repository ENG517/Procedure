# Procedure 3 - Troubleshooting a Wi-Fi Router

I began my third procedure, which is for medium-level users who need to troubleshoot issues with their Wi-Fi router. 


**Completed Work**
- Started on my third procedure: 'troubleshootwifirouter' 
- Procedure's goal: Successfully troubleshoot issues with Wi-Fi router. 
- I laid out the basic sections with headers, added some text and an image (I may look for a second one later), and made an empty numbered list for my steps to go into, as well as an empty materials section I'll fill in soon. 


# User Scenario - First-Time Troubleshooter

**Scenario**: "Pam and Gray are an elderly couple in their late 60s. They're experiencing issues with their Synology WRX650 (spotty connectivity, slow internet, etc). While they're familiar with the installation process and the different parts of the router, they aren't familiar with the troubleshooting process. They're looking for a helpful, easy-to-read guide that will help them identify the issue they need to troubleshoot right now, as well as provide them with several troubleshooting techniques they can use to resolve future issues." 


## Notable Review Requests

- Similar questions to before; does the introduction feel too short, is the format well-organized, and is the image of decent quality?
- This one is more sparse than the other 2 so far, just because it's a bit different in focus than the other two and requires more research. I'll add the content and images soon. Let me know if you notice any issues with what I've added so far!
- Should the language be adjusted in a certain way for this procedure? It's a very similar audience to the second procedure (medium-level users), so I didn't see a need to make the language any different, but I'm open to ideas. I just wasn't sure if the straightforward and professional tone fits here, or if it needs to be more casual and slow.
