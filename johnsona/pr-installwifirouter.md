# Procedure 1 - Installing a Wi-Fi Router

I began my first procedure, which is for beginner-level users who want to install a Synology WRX560 Wi-Fi router in their home. 


**Completed Work**
- Started on my first procedure: 'installnewwifirouter'
- Procedure's goal: To successfully install a Synology WRX560 Wi-Fi router. 
- I laid out the basic sections with headers, added some text and images, and made empty numbered lists that my steps will go into. 


# User Scenario - Title Here

**Scenario**: "Alyssa and Kaiya are college roommates in their early 20s. They need to set up a Wi-Fi router to get internet access for their school and work devices, but neither of them have ever installed one before and they don't have a lot of experience with installing hardware or with the terminology used to describe Wi-Fi routers. They just purchased a Synology WRX560 router and want quick, simple instructions."


## Notable Review Requests
- Should I pad out that introductory text under the title a little bit? I feel like it's super blunt and quick, but I didn't want to add too much filler or give the procedure a tone that doesn't fit the assignment. 
- How does the layout look so far? I hope to add the actual steps and more content soon when I have the time, but I tried to go ahead and situate the structure now. It was also important to me to have a section for terminology, since that fits the beginner-level audience of this procedure.
- Are the photos sufficient? This one's a bit tough to get creative photos for, so the only idea I have so far is just showing what the specific Wi-Fi router looks like from the front and back.
