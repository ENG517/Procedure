# Place and Format Images

### Introduction
By using image frames, you can add images into your document. Once you have assembled your images, created the document, and made the desired master pages, you can use image frames to add photos and other visual elements into the magazine.

## 1. Create image frames

Select the _Rectangle Frame Tool_ and draw a frame on the page where you want the image to go.

## 2. Place your photo

Use _File_ > _Place_ to select your image file, or paste the image onto the artboard, to the side of the page, and drag and drop the file onto the frame

## 3. Position and Scale
- Use the **Selection Tool (v)** to move the image.
- Use the **Direct Selection Tool (a)** (the white arrow) to move the image inside the frame, without changing the frame size.
- Use the **Free Transform Tool** to move the image inside the frame, without changing the frame size.

## 4. Fit to Frame:

Right click on the image frame and select "Fitting" to choose options like _Fill Frame Proportionally_ or _Fit Center to Frame_.
