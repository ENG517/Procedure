# Creating Parent Pages


## Introduction

Parent pages (sometimes referred to as "master pages") in InDesign help you maintain consistency in your magazine layout by providing guides for the the placement of images and text. A parent page is essentially a template which you can re-use for each page in the magazine, allowing you to create images and columns of text that appear in consistent locations. If you want to use a different layout for different articles in the magazine, you can create a new parent page that corresponds to each new section.

## Prequisites

Before you get started with the parent page, be sure to:
- Assemble the content for your magazine, including images, articles, and interviews
- Create a hand-drawn sketch for each page in the document, to serve as a visual reference for your project
- Create a document in InDesign
- Configure setting for your desired page dimensions and number of pages
- Add bleed and margins, so you know where images and text frames should begin and end

## 1. Create a new master page

1. In InDesign, open the pages panel (_Windows_ > _Pages_)
2. In the upper right corner of the panel, click the small icon containing 4 horizontal bars.
3. Select _New Parent..._ from the dropdown menu.
4. Add a prefix letter in the New Parent dialog box. Your first parent should be "A", continuing through the alphabet for each new parent page.
5. Add a name for the master page in the dialog box that appears
4. Click "OK"
>Note: When you have done this successfully, you will see your newly named parent page appear in the pages menu on the right side of the page.

## 2. Add column guides

1. In the _Pages_ panel, double-click the newly created parent page to open it in your workspace
2. Select the _Layout_ menu from the main toolbar and select _Margins and Columns_
3. In the dialog box, type the desired number of columns
4. Set the spacing between the columns, known as "gutters"
>Note: .25 inches is a good place to start for gutters, but if you are creating four or more columns, you may want to go smaller
4. Check the box marked "Preview" so that you can view your guides on the page as your create them
5. Click "OK"

## 3. Apply the master page
1. Go back to the _Pages_ panel, and select the parent page at the top of the panel, which will be indicated by a letter in the top corner of the page. (your first parent page will be marked with an "A")
2. Click on the master page thumbnail and drag it down to the thumbnail for the desired document page
3. Apply the master page by releasing the mouse button when a black rectangle appears on the border of the page

## Next Steps
Now you can begin consistently placing elements into your magazine. If you want each article to have a specific look, you can create a different master page for each section of the magazine.
