# Creating Master Pages

### Why do I need a master page?

    Master pages in Indesign help you maintain consistency in your magazine layout by providing guidelines for the placement of images and text. 

### How do I get started?

    Once you have assembled the content for your magazine, like images and articles, we recommend creating handrawn sketches to determine the layout. While things may change as you work on your document, having a sketched version of the magazine will help you determine how many pages to add to the document, and how may columns of text you will need on each page. 

## Prequisites

Before you get started with the master page, be sure to:
- Create a document in InDesign.
- Configure setting for your desired page dimensions and number of pages.
- Add bleed and margins, so you know where images and text frames should begin and end.

## Create a new master page
1. In InDesign, open the pages panel (_Windows_ > _Pages_)
2. In the upper section of the panel, click the _Create New Master Page_ icon at the top right of the panel.

3. Add a name for the master page in the dialog box that appears.
4. Click "OK"

## Add column guides
1. In the _Pages_ panel, double-click the newly created master page to open it in your window.
2. Go to the menu and select _Layout_ > _Margins and Columns_
3. In the dialog box, type the desired number of columns and set the spacing between the columns, known as "gutters".
4. Check the box marked "Preview" so that you can view your guides on the page as your create them.
5. Click "OK"

## Apply the master page
1. Go back to the _Pages_ panel, and select the master page at the top of the panel. It will be indicated by a letter, so your first master page will be "A".
2. Click on the master page thumbnail and drag it down to the thumbnail for the desired document page.
3. Apply the master page by releasing the mouse button when a black rectangle appears on the border of the page.

## Next Steps
Now you can begin consistently placing elements into your magazine. If you want each article to have a specific look, you can create a different master page for each section of the magazine.
