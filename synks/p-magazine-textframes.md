# How to Insert and Edit Text

## Introduction

Text can be inserted into the pages of your project in Indesign using text frames. Text frames should be added into your magazine pages using the guides that you create in your parent pages (See "How to Create Parent Pages"). You will not know exactly how many pages you will need for each article until you see how your written content falls on the page based on the number of columns you selected in your parent page, and the font size and line spacing you choose for the text in the columns. So, this will be an iterative process, where the number of pages will be determined and adjusted as you go along.

## Prerequisites
Before you get started with the parent page, be sure to:
- Assemble the content for your magazine, including images, articles, and interviews
- Create a hand-drawn sketch for each page in the document, to serve as a visual reference for your project
- Create a document in InDesign
- Create layout guides for each article using parent pages

### 1. Create Text Frames
1. Select the type tool and drag the text frame so that it overlays the guide lines from your parent page
2. Delete stock text
3. Copy and paste your text into the text frame
>Note: Start by pasting one paragraph into the text frame and selecting your desired font size.

### 2. Select Character Formatting

1. Open the _Type_ menu in the toolbar and select _Character_
2. Select the text in the text frame
3. Choose your font and font style
>Note: For readability and consistency, it is best to choose one font and font size for all the articles in your magazine. Once you have chosen a font and line spacing that looks good, you can apply it consistently throughout your project.
4. Choose your leading size, which is the space between text lines. The leading size should be approximately 1.5 times the size of your font.

### 3. Select Paragraph Style

While it is best to choose one font for all the articles, you may want to create multiple paragraph styles so that you can have a consistent output for additional text like captions or titles. Creating a new paragraph style for each output allows you to consistently apply changes to each output format.

1. Open the _Window_ menu in the toolbar and select _Styles_ > _Paragraph Styles_
2. In the _Paragraph Style Options_ dialog box, select your desired font, size, color, indents, and spacing.
3. To apply the new paragraph style, select the text you want to format and click the new paragraph style that you created in the Paragraph Styles panel.
