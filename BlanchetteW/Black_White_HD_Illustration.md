## Crafting Realistic Black and White Images in Figma ##

Whether you are an experienced artist adept at rendering complex hand-drawn illustrations or someone just starting out drawing, you have likely thought about trying your hand at digital illustration. Perhaps you have even heard of popular design tools like Adobe Illustrator, Canva, and Sketch. While all of these softwares have their benefits, I am here to talk to you about **Figma**, and more specifically the ease with which you can craft realistic black and white images and illustrations within its built-in environments.

The benefits of drawing in a monochromatic or *grayscale* palette are extensive. By sticking with black and white, form, **contrast**, and fundamental elements like ***line*** and ***shape*** are emphasized. I mean, black and white illustrations and drawings are a timeless medium, just consider the following images:

<img src="assets/images/BW_Illustrations/Shel-Silverstein-Illustration.jpg" alt="Alt text" style="width: 140px; height: 120 ">
<img src="assets/images/BW_Illustrations/MC_Escher_Hands.jpeg" alt="Alt text"  style="width: 180px; height: 120px">. 

Depending on your artistic expertise, creating images like these will not be something you will be able to do instantly, but getting started drawing in Figma is now easier than ever with the introduction of **Figma Draw**, a dedicated workspace in Figma purely for expressive vector illustration and visual design.

## Prequisites ##
In addition to Figma, you will need to utilize the [MonoMagic]("https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1301603282794767236/monomagic-desaturate-frames-vectors") plugin to achieve an authentic Grayscale. I recommend saving or bookmarking this software.

## Getting Started with Figma Draw ##

To open up Figma Draw:
1. Open up a dedicated Figma workspace.
2. Then select the Draw icon located in the toolbar on the bottom of the screen.  
(*Note: Figma Draw may not be availabe on all mobile devices.*)

## Choosing a Drawing Tool ##
There are three drawing apparatuses available in Figma Draw, other than the shape tool, for creating vector based drawings. All are accessible via the toolbar.

1. ### The pen ###
  - Great for clear, concise lines.
  - Easily bendable.
2. ### The pencil ###
- Great for freehand drawing.
- Great for unstructured, organic shapes,
3. ### The brush ###
- Only available in Figma draw mode.
- Great for hand painted textures and varying line weights.
