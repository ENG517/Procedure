# Procedure Assignment Reflection

Write a short analysis (~500 words) in which you explain what you did to meet the assignment's criteria. Use the criteria as headings to structure your reflection.

## How do your procedures address the needs of a "reading to learn to do audience"? Provide some specific examples that connect back to Redish's noted features of such an audience.

Figma is not the easiest or most intuitive program to use, especially if you have no prior experience with vector based drawing or other design software. That's why, with my targeted audience being beginners, I 1) tried to pick both relatively easy goals 2) tried to be as comprehensive as possible, even with fairly self-explanatory tasks.

The hope is that the user gleaned enough knowledge from these tasks to understand what both a raster and vector image are and the difference between them,  some of the basic layouts and features I.e. the properties panel, toolbar, and drawing methods, and also how to achieve the goal of each procedure. With these skills and knowledge in place, they will hopefully be encouraged to use Figma in other capacities like web, product or graphic design, especially with all the features of Figma that are embedded within the screenshots and intentionally not addressed.


## How do your procedures follow the WTGA Staging, Coaching, and Alerting stylistic conventions? Provide some specific examples that connect back to the criteria from Hart-Davidson.



## How do your procedures follow your task orientation work? In other words, based on your audience and their goals, discuss how you oriented your SCA moves to the tasks.



## How did you apply a basic docs-as-code editorial workflow to your assignment? Please provide specific cases with screenshots and/or links that can support your claims.



## How did you apply a consistent use of the Markdown language throughout your project? Please provide specific cases with screenshots and/or links that can support your claims.
