## User Scenario
Stephanie is a freehand illustrator who has worked in-house at Penguin Random House for over 30 years bringing childrenâ€™s books to life. She has worked exclusively with hand-drawn illustrations her whole career, most being in black and white. Yesterday a client came to Penguin asking for digital illustrations. They would like for these illustrations to "mirror" Stephanie's freehand work.

Stephanie read online that Figma has increased drawing capabilities and would like to learn how to craft digital images in the software.
