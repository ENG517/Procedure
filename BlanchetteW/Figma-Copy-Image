# Tracing Hand-Drawn Images in Figma #

Have you ever had a sketch you've created and wondered how it would translate to the digital realm? Of course you could always take a picture, or a *pixelated* image, but there is another type of image, the [***vector***](https://heighton.agency/insights/vector-files/), which provides several distinct benefits.

Vector images are comprised of mathematical formulas defining points, lines and curves, and can be scaled infinitely and to different screen sizes without loss of quality. They are easily translated to other image formats, flexible, and essential to design software of all stripes, including Figma. 

Currently, the only method for converting an image to a vector in figma is through **tracing** it, which is much easier if completed using the help of a third-party plugin. I will walk you through some of the process in a few short and easy steps.
