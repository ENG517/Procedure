# Copying hand drawn-imags in Figma 




**Completed Work**
Added barebones procedure. Only have task outlines, need to add steps, images.

## User Scenario
Terrence is a college senior at the Academy of The Arts studying illustration. In his time at school, he has done everything from sample images for advertisements, charicatures for the school's satire newspaper, cartoons, and children's books. 

His real passion, however, lies in concept art. Terrence has always been a sci-fi junkie and enjoys hand-sketching elaborate cityscapes, fantasy backgrounds, and futurist characters and technology. His portfolio of these drawings being so extensive, in fact, that he was able to acquire an internship with Harper Voyager, a sci-fi focused imprint of Harper Collins.

Perhaps even more importantly, Harper Voyager would like to use one of Terrence's drawings for one of their represented writers! His first task is to both digitize and colorize the selected illustration for their use.

## Notable Review Requests
I would mainly like to discuss if this should be two goals or could work as one. This procedure is very barebones as of now.
