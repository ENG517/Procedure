# Importing Hand-Drawn Images
Gary has worked as a freelance illustrator in the publishing industry for the past fifteen years and has built relationships with authors and publishing agencies spanning numerous genres, including fantasy, science fiction, comic books, and academic textbooks. Most of the time Gary will hand off his hand drawn drawings to either authors directly or the agency he’s working with, who then handle the digitization of his work.

Recently Gary was approached by DC comics to work on a popular comic book series. He has done some graphic illustrations for this series prior but never directly worked with DC, who has quite a robust team working on the project both internally and within their parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery. 

The team he’s working on recently transitioned to Figma for its collaborative power, not only amongst the illustrators but also with DC’s in-house web designers. They would like for Gary to give a short virtual presentation of work he’s created prior for the series, and would like for his images to be in Figma so other team members can offer real-time feedback and comments.
