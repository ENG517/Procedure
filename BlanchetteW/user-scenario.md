## Importing and Digitizing Hand Drawn Images in Figma ##
Terrence is a college senior at the Academy of The Arts studying illustration. In his time at school, he has done everything from sample illustrations for advertisements, charicatures for the school's satire newspaper, cartoons, and children's books. 

His real passion, however, lies in concept art. Terrence has always been a sci-fi junkie and enjoys hand-sketching elaborate cityscapes, fantasy backgrounds, and futurist characters and technology. His portfolio of these drawings being so extensive, in fact, that he was able to acquire an internship with Harper Voyager, a sci-fi focused imprint of Harper Collins.

Perhaps even more importantly, Harper Voyager would like to use one of Terrence's drawings for one of their represented writers! His first task is to both digitize and colorize the selected illustration for their use, and they would like for it to be in vector format to scale up for promotional materials they are going to create to advertise the release of the author's new novel.
