## Hand Drawn Illustration ##
 Stephanie is a freehand illustrator who has worked in-house at Penguin Random House for over 30 years bringing their children’s books to life. She has worked exclusively with hand-drawn illustrations her whole career. Yesterday, a client came to Penguin asking for digital illustrations. 
 
The client is aware that digital illustrations are not Stephanie's forté, but really read that Figma has increased drawing capabilities and she would like to learn how to craft draft digital images in the software that mirror her freehand work.
