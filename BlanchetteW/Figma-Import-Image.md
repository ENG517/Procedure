# Importing and Editing Images in Figma ##

Whether you are an illustrator, photographer, graphic designer, or just looking to create a meme, the benefits of working with an image in Figma are immense. Because imported or [Raster Images](https://shorthand.com/the-craft/raster-images/index.html) are treated as an ***Image Fill***, editable properties like color, exposure, and contrast and layer effects like blurs and drop shadows are easily manipulated. Raster images are also easily cropped and resized and can capture many photorealistic details that *Vector Based* images won't.

Perhaps most importantly, by importing images you enable the collaborative capabilities of Figma, allowing for up to **500** collabarators to make real-time edits and offer up suggestions, streamlining both brainstorming and ideation.

Overall, the process is quite simple and requires only a few easy steps.

### Prerequisites ###
You will need an image to import. Currently, Figma supports **JPG, PNG, GIF, WEBP,** and **HEIC** formats.
> Note: Different image formats are ideal for different image types. Read more about which format might be right for yours [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Guides/Formats/Image_types).
