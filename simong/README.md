# Expedia Procedures

I created 3 procedures for Expedia Users:

- Booking a Package
- Finding Support
- Selecting Flight Seats

Each procedure guides users through the assigned task, teaching and providing helpful information to guide their process. Users complete the procedures with new knowledge and actionable steps to solve their problems, giving them clarity and excitement in using Expedia for their travel needs.
