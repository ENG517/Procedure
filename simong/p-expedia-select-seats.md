## About Selecting Flight Seats
A benefit to most Expedia flights is the option to select seats. The process to select seats through Expedia's site involves choosing and confirming seats. The visual process helps to make choosing the best seat a seamless experience.

## Prerequistes
You must select a flight option that allows for seat selection.
    The ability to select seats is dependent on the flight class (eg., economy plus, business).
Depending on the airline, you may need to book the flight first before you are eligible to select seats.
The seat selection section can be found in the Flight Details page of your booking.
