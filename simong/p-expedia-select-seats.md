# Selecting Flight Seats on Expedia

A benefit to most Expedia flights is the option to select seats. The process to select seats through Expedia's site involves choosing and confirming seats. The visual process, which immitates a birds-eye view of the plane's interior, helps to make choosing the best seat a seamless experience.

This guide will teach you how to:

* Choose Seats
* Change Seats

## Prerequistes
- You must select a flight option that allows for seat selection.
    - The ability to select seats is dependent on the flight class (eg., economy plus, business).

- Depending on the airline, you may need to book the flight first before you are eligible to select seats.

> If the airline requires you to first book the flight, you will use the personalized flight number attached to your email receipt to find your information on the airline's website. From there, you will be able to personalize your experience, which will include the option to select your seat preferences.

## Getting Started 

As you are finalizing your flight, head to the **flight details** section in your booking process.

## Choosing Seats

Once you have arrived to the flight details page in your booking process, you will now have the option to select your seats.
