# User Scenario - Selecting Flight Seats on Expedia

**Scenario**: Tina and Daniel recently got married. With the major wedding costs, they thought they had to delay the honeymoon. That is, until Tina saw a commercial for Expedia.

As her way of surprising him, she would like to reserve a window seat to ensure that he gets the best views as they reach the islands.
