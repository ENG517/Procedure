- Tick the **Point of Sale** checkbox at the top of the product.  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** Mismatch between physical product counts and instances of the product in the system may lead to oversold products, unreported stock-outs, and incorrect reporting.

- Select a product under the **Product** column.  
- Set the value of the product in the **Counted Quantity** column.  
- Click **Apply** on the far right of the page to create an adjustment.  

### Step 3: Validate Adjustment
- Check the **Counted Quantity**, **On Hand Quantity**, and **Difference** amounts.  

üìå **Note:**  
- If the Counted Quantity is greater than the On Hand Quantity, the value in the Difference column is **green**.  
- If the Counted Quantity is less than the On Hand Quantity, the value in the Difference column is **red**.  
- If the quantities match and have not been changed, no value appears in the Difference column.  


### Step 4: View Adjustment History
- Click **History** to view the adjustment history.  
- The user who performed the count is listed in parentheses in the **Reference** field, while the user who applied the count is listed in **Done By**.  

üìå **Note:** If the POS system is offline, the changes are cached and synced with the server later.  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** Sync failure may result in count mismatch, resulting in cashiers selling items that are not in stock.
