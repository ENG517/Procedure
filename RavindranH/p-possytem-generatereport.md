  ## Device Requirements

- **Receipt/Report Printer**: OPOS-compliant printer (thermal/impact) for printing summary reports  
- **Cash Drawer (Optional)**: Connected to the POS for reconciliation of cash transactions

- **External Storage/Export Device (Optional)**: USB drive or secure network folder for exporting reports  

---

## Prerequisites

- User must have **Manager** or **Accounting** role access credentials  
- All sales terminals should be closed for the day (no open transactions)  
- Cashiers should have performed **till reconciliation** (cash count) before report generation  
- Date and time settings on POS workstation should be accurate  
- Optional: Email or cloud export configured for automated report distribution 

## Step-by-Step Procedure
1. **Login to POS System**  
   - Enter *Manager/Accountant* credentials.  
   - Navigate to the **Back Office** or **Reports** module.  

2. **Select Report Type**  
   - Choose **End-of-Day / Z-Report** (often also called "Daily Closure Report").  
   - Options may include:  
     - Sales Summary  
     - Revenue by Payment Type (cash, card, digital wallet)  
     - Tax Summary  
     - Discounts and Voids  
     - Inventory Adjustments  

3. **Set Report Parameters**  
   - Confirm the business date (usually defaults to current date).  
   - Select outlets/registers if multiple POS terminals are in use.  
   - Choose report format: on-screen preview, printed report, or exported file (CSV, PDF, Excel).  

4. **Generate Report**  
   - Click **Generate**.  
   - POS system compiles all transaction data for the selected period.  
   - Verify totals for:  
     - Gross Sales  
     - Net Sales  
     - Total Payments by method  
     - Refunds/Returns  
     - Taxes  

5. **Print or Export Report**  
   - Print report using connected OPOS-compliant printer.  
   - Or, export digitally (CSV/PDF/Excel) to local device, USB, or cloud storage.  

6. **Close the Business Day (Optional)**  
   - If system supports automated day closure, confirm to lock transactions for the day.  
   - This prevents further changes to the sales data for auditing compliance.

## Notes
- **End-of-Day vs. X-Report**:  
  - An *X-Report* is a mid-shift sales report that does not reset counters.  
  - A *Z-Report* (End-of-Day report) resets counters and finalizes the day.  
- Ensure all tills are reconciled **before** generating the report to avoid mismatched totals.  
- For cloud-based POS systems, reports may be automatically emailed to the accounting team.  
- Security tip: Reports should only be accessible by authorized staff to protect financial data.  
- Audit compliance: Keep daily Z-reports archived for the period required by local tax authorities.
