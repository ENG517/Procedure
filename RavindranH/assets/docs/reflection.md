# Procedure Assignment Reflection

Write a short analysis (~500 words) in which you explain what you did to meet the assignment's criteria. Use the criteria as headings to structure your reflection.

## How do your procedures address the needs of a "reading to learn to do audience"? Provide some specific examples that connect back to Redish's noted features of such an audience.

- As per Redish, a “reading to learn to do” audience is goal-oriented, they don’t read the procedures to gain knowledge from it, but to immediately apply their readings to solve problems at work. As a result, they are often time-sensitive and prone to multi-tasking. 
- To cater to these demands, I’ve written goal-oriented procedures that instantly convey what the reader can achieve with the text. I’ve also avoided large blocks of content and maintained shorter headings and paragraphs, reducing cognitive load.
- I’ve organized each procedure as an independent unit that exists on its own. This way the guide is flexible enough to be used by new users without getting overwhelmed, and expert users can skip parts they already know. I’ve also used simple, procedural language, along with being sensitive to error states by providing visual cues. 

## How do your procedures follow the WTGA Staging, Coaching, and Alerting stylistic conventions? Provide some specific examples that connect back to the criteria from Hart-Davidson.

- I’ve incorporated the Staging move by beginning each procedure with a clear goal and objective that tells the user what the procedure will help them achieve. I’ve also included preexisting conditions along with outcomes, so users know what they’ll accomplish by the end of the task. 

- As for the Coaching move, I’ve structured the procedure to include step-by-step instructions that start with imperative verbal phrases. Each instruction tells the user what they must do, and how the system responds to their action.

- And for the Alerting move, I’ve added visually distinctive warnings, notes, and tips along with the steps. These are crucial pointers that inform users of what they must avoid doing, and how to tackle error states and system failures. 

## How do your procedures follow your task orientation work? In other words, based on your audience and their goals, discuss how you oriented your SCA moves to the tasks.

- The procedures are structured to start with task orientation, focusing more on what the audience wants to accomplish with the Odoo POS system and less on what features and functionalities are available in the system. 
- The audience for my procedures is front-desk staff in retail, POS managers, and supervisors. Their goals are to place an order, generate reports, adjust inventory, and apply promotions on the orders. With these goals in mind, I’ve shaped my SCA moves around each task in the following ways:

**Staging**

 I’ve included clear goals, purposes, outcomes, and prerequisites for each procedure. This way the audience are not just reading tasks with no direction, but they’re aware why the task matters. For example, in a procedure for placing an order, I elaborate about creating products first as products cannot be sold without being configured in the POS system. 

**Coaching**

I’ve used action-oriented verbs such as **Click**, **Select**, and **Apply** to guide users not through features but through actions. 

**Alerting**

I’ve highlighted common error states by alerting the users to avoid pitfalls in the product. Apart from providing critical cues, I’ve also ensured that conditional statements begin with conditions, allowing audience to evaluate the condition fist and then the action.  

## How did you apply a basic docs-as-code editorial workflow to your assignment? Please provide specific cases with screenshots and/or links that can support your claims.

- To apply a docs-as-code editorial workflow, I drafted the procedures in MarkDown and stored them in a GitHub repository. This ensured every change made to the content was effectively versioned and tracked. Since each branch was independent, any errors or mistakes were specific to that branch only and did not affect the rest of the content. 
- Additionally, I created a branch for each procedure and included the common prerequisites such as system and hardware requirements in the **Main** branch. 
- I then created pull requests for each branch, for peer reviews, ensuring multiple people could review my content simultaneously. I also made meaningful edits to the branches with each commit.

Here are links to my branches:
- [Branch1](https://github.com/ENG517/Procedure/tree/Ravindran-possystem-updateinventory)
- [Branch2](https://github.com/ENG517/Procedure/tree/Ravindran-possystem-applydiscountsandloyalty)

Here are links to my pull requests:

## How did you apply a consistent use of the Markdown language throughout your project? Please provide specific cases with screenshots and/or links that can support your claims.

I applied Markdown language throughout the project by consistently using it to create headings, lists, links, blockquotes, images, and text formatting.
