## User Scenario

-

Below our some guiding questions and concerns, regarding the above work. Reviewers can use this information to start their review process, but need not limit their feedback to these items alone.

Do the how to start a Teams meeting and how to use audio need to be flushed out more? I feel like those should be theier own tasks in a link or something. 
Does this work well for beginners?
