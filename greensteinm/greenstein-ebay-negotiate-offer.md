# How to Negotiate Offers on eBay

## To Prepare Before Receiving Offers

**1. Decide your bottom line.**
   - Research the average sold price of your item.
   - Determine your lowest acceptable price before negotiating.
   - Factor in eBay fees, shipping costs, and the item condition.

**2. Plan negotiation flexibility.**
   - Decide if youâ€™ll leave room in your price for counteroffers. For example, if your target is $80, you might list at $100 to allow negotiation.

**Recommended steps:**
  - When creating your listing, enable the *Best Offer* option.
  - Set *automatic acceptance* for offers at or above your desired minimum and/or *automatic decline* for offers too low.
