# How to Negotiate Offers on eBay

## To Prepare Before Receiving Offers

**1. Decide your bottom line.**
   - Research the average sold price of your item.
   - Determine your lowest acceptable price before negotiating.
   - Factor in eBay fees, shipping costs, and the item condition.

**2. Plan negotiation flexibility.**
   - Decide if you’ll leave room in your price for counteroffers. For example, if your target is $80, you might list at $100 to allow negotiation.

**Recommended steps:**
  - When creating your listing, enable the *Best Offer* option.
  - Set *automatic acceptance* for offers at or above your desired minimum and/or *automatic decline* for offers too low.

## Handling Incoming Offers

**1. Review each offer carefully.**
   - Look at the offer amount.
   - Check buyer feedback and history if it's available.
   - Consider your current demand. Are there other potential buyers watching the item, submitting offers, or bidding?

**2. Decide how to respond.** There are three options:
   - ***Accept***: If the offer meets your minimum price or is higher than expected.
   - ***Decline***: If the offer is far below your bottom line.
   - ***Counteroffer***: If you’re open to negotiation but want a higher price.

**3. Use counteroffers strategically.**
   - Counter with a price closer to your goal while being flexible. For example, if the listing price is $100 and the potential buyer offers $60, counter with $85.
   - Keep in mind buyers can walk away, so don’t counter too aggressively.

**4. Respond promptly.**
   - eBay requires a response within 48 hours. Quick replies encourage buyers to stay engaged.

### Buyer-Seller Communication Tips

- **Stay professional and polite.**
   - Avoid emotional responses to “lowball” offers.
   - Example response in counteroffer note: *“Thanks for your interest! I can meet you at $85, which I think is a fair value given the item’s condition.”*
- **Consider highlighting the item's value.**
   - Briefly remind buyers why your item is worth your price (brand, rarity, condition, free shipping, etc.).
- **Avoid over-negotiating.**
   - Too many back-and-forth counteroffers can frustrate buyers.
   - Stick to roughly 1–2 rounds of negotiation.
