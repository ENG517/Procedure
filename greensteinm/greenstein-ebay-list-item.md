# How to List an Item on eBay

## Prepare Before Listing

**1. Create an eBay account** if you don't already have one.
   - Go to [ebay.com](https://www.ebay.com).
   - Click ***register*** in the top left corner. [Add screenshot of register button]
   - Follow the prompts to register for a personal account.
     - You will need a valid phone number, email address, and payment details (for fees and payouts).
     - If you plan to sell a large number of items, or sell on behalf of a business or nonprofit, register under the ***Business*** tab.

**2.** Once you have created your account, **research your item.**
   - Search current eBay listings for:
     - average listed and sold prices,
     - how other sellers title and describe the item, and
     - which item categories they use.
       - Use the search filters to sort by sold items to see "completed" (sold) listings. [Add screenshot of search filters]
   - Decide whether to list your item for a **fixed price** (Buy It Now) or put it up for **auction**. 

**3. Gather item specifications and details.**
   - Item specifications can include brand, model, size, color, condition, serial number, and important features. 
     - For clothing and shoes, include measurements, tags, and fabric type.
     - For electronic devices, test their functionality and reset if needed before listing.

**4. Take high quality photos.**
   - Use natural lighting and a clean background
   - Capture multiple angles of the item (front, back, sides, close-ups of flaws). 
     - If the listing includes multiple items (i.e., a set of salt and pepper shakers), photograph the items together *and* separately.
   - Include original packaging if available.
