# How to List an Item on eBay

## Prepare Before Listing

**1. Create an eBay account** if you don't already have one.
   - Go to [ebay.com](https://www.ebay.com)
   - Click ***register*** in the top left corner. [Add screenshot of register button]
   - Follow the prompts to register for a personal account.
     - You will need a valid phone number, email address, and payment details (for fees and payouts).
     - If you plan to sell a large number of items, or sell on behalf of a business or nonprofit, register under the ***Business*** tab.

**2.** Once you have created your account, **research your item.**
   - Search current eBay listings for:
     - average listed and sold prices,
     - how other sellers title and describe the item, and
     - which item categories they use.
       - Use the search filters to sort by sold items to see "completed" (sold) listings. [Add screenshot of search filters]
   - Decide whether to list your item for a **fixed price** (Buy It Now) or put it up for **auction**.
