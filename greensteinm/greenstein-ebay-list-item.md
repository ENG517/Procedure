# How to List an Item on eBay

## Prepare Before Listing

**1. Create an eBay account** if you don't already have one.
   - Go to [ebay.com](https://www.ebay.com).
   - Click ***register*** in the top left corner. [Add screenshot of register button]
   - Follow the prompts to register for a personal account.
     - You will need a valid phone number, email address, and payment details (for fees and payouts).
     - If you plan to sell a large number of items, or sell on behalf of a business or nonprofit, register under the ***Business*** tab.

**2.** Once you have created your account, **research your item.**
   - Search current eBay listings for:
     - average listed and sold prices,
     - how other sellers title and describe the item, and
     - which item categories they use.
       - Use the search filters to sort by sold items to see "completed" (sold) listings. [Add screenshot of search filters]
   - Decide whether to list your item for a **fixed price** (Buy It Now) or put it up for **auction**. 

**3. Gather item specifications and details.**
   - Item specifications can include brand, model, size, color, condition, serial number, and important features. 
     - For clothing and shoes, include measurements, tags, and fabric type.
     - For electronic devices, test their functionality and reset if needed before listing.

**4. Take high quality photos.**
   - Use natural lighting and a clean background
   - Capture multiple angles of the item (front, back, sides, close-ups of flaws). 
     - If the listing includes multiple items (i.e., a set of salt and pepper shakers), photograph the items together *and* separately.
   - Include original packaging if available.
   - eBay allows up to 24 free photos per listing.

## Create the Listing

**1. Log into eBay.**
   - Click ***sell*** in the top right corner.

**2. Choose a selling format.**
   - Enter your item name in the search bar. eBay may suggest categories and listing templates.
   - Confirm the best category (e.g., Electronics > Cell Phones > Smartphones).

**3. Write the listing title.**
   - Be descriptive but concise. Include brand, model, and size. If there is room, feel free to include some of the item's defining features.
   - Example: *Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max – 256GB – Graphite (Unlocked)*

**4. Select item specifics.**
   - Fill in eBay’s fields (brand, size, color, material, style, UPC, etc.).
   - Accurate details help buyers find your item in search.

**5. Write the item description.**
   - Include condition (new, gently used, refurbished, etc.).
   - Highlight key features and benefits.
   - Disclose flaws honestly to avoid returns.
   - Optional: Use bullet points for readability.

**6. Upload photos.**
   - Ensure they are clear, high-quality, and distinctly show any imperfections.
   - Make sure the first photo acts as a cover, and clearly shows the full object.

**7. Set the price.**
   - **Auction format:** Choose starting bid, duration (1–10 days), and optional reserve price.
   - **Buy It Now:** Set a fixed price based on research.
     - Consider offering “Best Offer” so buyers can negotiate.

**8. Set shipping options.**
   - Choose shipping service (USPS, UPS, FedEx, etc.).
   - Decide if you’ll offer free shipping or buyer-pays.
   - Use eBay’s shipping calculator to estimate costs.
   - Pack and weigh your item before listing for accuracy.

**9. Choose payment method.**
   - eBay uses *Managed Payments*, so funds go directly to your linked bank account.

**10. Review fees.**
   - eBay charges a final value fee (usually a % of sale + processing fee).
   - If you exceed your free monthly listings, there may be additional fees.

**11. Click *List item* to publish your listing.**
