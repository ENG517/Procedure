# How to Optimize Your Listings as an Expert eBay Seller

## Optimize Listings for SEO & Buyer Behavior

**1. Craft keyword-rich titles.**
  - Use all 80 characters, focusing on buyer search terms (brand, model, size, color, style).
  - Avoid unnecessary filler words.

**2. Leverage item specifics.**
  - Fill in every detail (UPC, material, measurements, compatibility, etc.).
  - These fields directly feed into eBayâ€™s search filters.

**3. Write detailed descriptions.**
  - Balance SEO keywords with readability.
  - Include brand story, rarity, or collector appeal if relevant.
  - Use formatting (bullet points, headers) for improved readability.
  - Keep a consistant format across the Storefront and communications with potential buyers.

**4. Use high-quality visuals.**
  - Shoot in natural light on a clean background.
  - Include lifestyle or scale photos to help buyers imagine usage.
  - Watermarking is optional, but avoid anything that clutters.
