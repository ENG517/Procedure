# How to Optimize Your Listings as an Expert eBay Seller

## Optimize Listings for SEO & Buyer Behavior

**1. Craft keyword-rich titles.**
  - Use all 80 characters, focusing on buyer search terms (brand, model, size, color, style).
  - Avoid unnecessary filler words.

**2. Leverage item specifics.**
  - Fill in every detail (UPC, material, measurements, compatibility, etc.).
  - These fields directly feed into eBay’s search filters.

**3. Write detailed descriptions.**
  - Balance SEO keywords with readability.
  - Include brand story, rarity, or collector appeal if relevant.
  - Use formatting (bullet points, headers) for improved readability.
  - Keep a consistant format across the Storefront and communications with potential buyers.

**4. Use high-quality visuals.**
  - Shoot in natural light on a clean background.
  - Include lifestyle or scale photos to help buyers imagine usage.
  - Watermarking is optional, but avoid anything that clutters.

## Maximize Visibility & Buyer Engagement

**1. List consistently.**
  - Daily or weekly listing activity signals eBay’s algorithm to boost your store visibility.

**2. Leverage eBay Promoted Listings.**
- Use Promoted Listings Standard for steady exposure.
- Experiment with Advanced (CPM) if margins allow, to dominate high-competition categories.

**3. Offer competitive shipping.**
- Free or flat-rate shipping increases search placement.
- Use calculated shipping for heavier items but optimize packaging to reduce costs.

**4. Run promotions and markdowns.**
- Create volume discounts (e.g., Buy 2, Get 10% Off).
- Use eBay’s Markdown Manager to create urgency with sales.

**5. Utilize multi-channel marketing.**
- Share listings on social media, blogs, or email newsletters.
- Drive repeat buyers directly to your eBay Store page.
