**Completed Work**

- Created new procedure: 'p-standomix300-make-meringue'
- Procedure's Goal: to make meringue cookies with the Stand'o'mix 300
- Laid out the basic sections and added first draft of steps
- Added images to repository and procedure

## User Scenario
"Chris has a small hobby baking business where he sells baked goods to friends, family, coworkers, and neighbors. He is a small-time baker and has only his home kitchen and appliances to make his baked goods. He wants to add meringue cookies to his offerings, but the process to make them by hand is too time consuming and tiring. He recently purchased a stand mixer to more efficiently make his current recipes, and has heard that a stand mixer can handle meringues efficiently and easily."

## Notable Review Requests:
- How is the layout so far, specifically with the ordered and unordered lists and alerts? I tried to make the alerts stand out more

- How are the steps, in terms of length and clarity?

- We're required to have images, so I tried to find ones that were constructive and supported the instructions. Are they? And how are the sizes?
