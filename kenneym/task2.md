# How to set up and reset The Landing for a presentation event

Seating arrangements in The Landing completely change the atmosphere of your event. The default arrangement of the space includes a communal group of tables with 10 chairs and a couple of tables with chairs along the back wall. 

We recommend a maximum capacity of 20 people in the room. This guide will show yuo how to orient the space for presentations facing the OLED screen. If you would like to have custom seating for a future event, fill out this form.

#### Prerequisites

* libraries staff permission to use the space
* Active presence inside the room
* Mobility capabilities for moving multiple chairs and tables

Note: One person can orient the landing without assistance. More people to help will make this process go faster!

### Materials in the Space

* Two large tables with wheels
* 10 seats with wheels
* 2 large bean bag chairs with ottomans

## Setting up for the presentation
Time - 15 minutes for one person

(1) Place the two large brown chairs and their ottomans on outside the door

Temporarily removing these chairs provides more space to position chairs in rows. These chairs are ideal for more casual events and providing comfortable spaces for students to study, unwind, and connect. 

(2) Move the chairs by the tables in rows to the front of the room

The amount of rows depends on how many people are in the space

(3) Press on the wheel's switch with your foot to unlock the wheel

(4) push the tables to the back of the room, against the wall opposite to the OLED screen

Note: if you experience (1) resistance from the table upon pushing or (2) the table veering to the left or right while pushing, this means one or more of the wheels are still locked. Return to step one and press down on the wheels to ensure all are unlocked.
