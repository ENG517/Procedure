# How to Use the Tools in the Landing

## Introduction
Welcome to The Landing, your space for wellness, presentation, and collaboration. The space contains board games, Legos, craft materials, and a variety of other hands-on activities. The room is equipped with a large LED touch-interactive display that is ideal for showcasing creative multimedia projects and scholarly work, exploring data, and collaborative coding exercises. We recommend a max capacity of 20 people in the space for reserved events. 

Part of what makes The Landing a unique space for hosting wellness events is that it is a permitted space for snacks and drinks. Areas like the Gaming & Esports Lab prohibit food and drinks due to the volume of tech permanently in the space, so the smaller, quieter area at The Landing offers the perfect location for a comprehensive hosting experience.

The Landing is located on the 3rd floor of the Hunt Library in Room 3201. The room should be unlocked and ready for your event upon your arrival. If the door is locked, please speak to the Ask Us desk to check out the key. 

The librarian or library specialist working with you during the process will be your first point of contact for questions or concerns with the space, and will be on-site the day of your event to assist with troubleshooting as needed. If internal attempts to resolve problems with the space do not work, please contact the Ask Us desk for physical concerns and the IT department for more in-depth technological resolution. 

To organize more reserved events in the space, please complete the request form, and a Libraries staff member will be in touch with you in 2-3 business days. Please submit the request at least 14 days in advance of the requested date.
