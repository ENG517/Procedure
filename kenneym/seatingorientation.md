# How to Curate the Landing for a Presentation Event

Seating arrangements in the Landing completely change the atmosphere of your event. The space includes tables and chairs both at the center of the space and against the walls that can be rolled around to better accomodate your event. 

We reccomend a maximum capacity of 20 people in the room. If you would like specific seating not outlined in this guide, please fill out **THIS FORM** This guide will show you to how orient the space for presentations requiring rows of seated attention toward the OLED screen.

## Prerequisites
* Event reservation confirmation
* Physical means to lift and push around tables and chairs

If you did not reserve the space for your event, please fill out **this form**

### Landing Seating Materials Checklist
* 2 tables
* 10 chairs
* 2 bean bag chairs
* 2 ottomans

## Task 1: Configuring the Room
Time - 15 minutes for one person

1. Place the two large brown chairs and their ottomans on outside the door.

 Temporarily removing these chairs provides more space to position chairs in rows. These chairs are ideal for more casual events and providing comfortable spaces for students to study, unwind, and connect. 

2. Move the chairs by the tables in rows to the front of the room.

    The amount of rows depends on how many people are in the space

3. Press on the wheel's switch with your foot to unlock the wheel.

4. Push the tables to the back of the room, against the wall opposite to the OLED screen.

    **Note:** If you experience (1) resistance from the table upon pushing or (2) the table veering to the left or right while pushing, this means one or more of the wheels are still locked. Return to step one and press down on the wheels to ensure all are unlocked. 

5. Lock all wheels once you are satisfied with your layout.

After Completing the steps above, the presentation space should look like this:

Congratulations, you have successfuly set up the Landing for your event! 

## Resetting the Landing to Default Orientation
Once your event has concluded and all event participants have vacated the space, you are ready to begin resetting the Landing to its default orientation. 

### Resetting the Tables and Chairs
Refer to the **default orientation** image for additional assistance in orienting the space. 

1. Unlock all wheels for the tables and chairs.

    You should now be able to move the furniture without resistance.
2. Push tables to their original spaces at the center of the room.
3. Surround the table with the chairs.
4. Place the 2 bean bag chairs and 2 ottomans back in the room against the wall
5. Push any extra chairs provided for your event towards the front of the room.

Once completed, the room should look like this:

### Logging out of the interface
1. Disconnect the HDMI port from the OLED insert and the laptop
2. On the interface panel, tap "sound" and turn the volume to 0
3. Tap "lights" and turn the lights to 50% brightness

    If the lights flicker, turn them off and message your librarian about your issue.

Note: If the lights begin to flicker, don't stress! This is **not** an issue you caused, and it is not a problem that can be solved without IT. We will fix this after you event concludes. 

4. On the interface panel, press and hold on the top right corner until the login screen appears.

Congratulations! You just operated a successful presentation event in the Landing! We hope the tools in the space fostered an environment of _ for your students.
