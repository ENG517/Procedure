# How to Orient the Landing for a Presentation Event

Seating arrangements in the Landing completely change the atmosphere of your event. The space includes tables and chairs both at the center of the space and against the walls that can be rolled around to better accomodate your event. 

We reccomend a maximum capacity of 20 people in the room. If you would like specific seating not outlined in this guide, please fill out **THIS FORM** This guide will show you to how orient the space for presentations requiring rows of seated attention toward the OLED screen.

## Prerequisites

## Landing Seating Materials Checklist

Task 1: Setting up for your presentation
Time - 15 minutes for one person

1. Place the two large brown chairs and their ottomans on outside the door
    Temporarily removing these chairs provides more space to position chairs in rows. These chairs are ideal for more casual events and providing comfortable spaces for students to study, unwind, and connect. 

2. Move the chairs by the tables in rows to the front of the room
    The amount of rows depends on how many people are in the space

3. Press on the wheel's switch with your foot to unlock the wheel

4. push the tables to the back of the room, against the wall opposite to the OLED screen

Note: if you experience (1) resistance from the table upon pushing or (2) the table veering to the left or right while pushing, this means one or more of the wheels are still locked. Return to step one and press down on the wheels to ensure all are unlocked. 

5. Lock all wheels once happy with your layout

Congratulations, you have successfuly set up the Landing for your event!
