## User Scenario

Dr. Erika Smith is an club event organizer who runs campus organizations for neurodivergent students
She needs to understand the basics of the space to run a wellness event without trouble while creating a sensory-safe event for club members, and wants to learn how the screen interface works to create a private, quiet space for a curated event. Their biggest priorities are logging into the interface, dimming the lights and windows to minimize harsh lighting and sound in the space so that they can be flexible with the computers, consoles, and board games working in the space, and knowing how to orient the area to accomodate those needs.
