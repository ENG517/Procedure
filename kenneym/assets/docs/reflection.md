# Procedure Assignment Reflection

Write a short analysis (~500 words) in which you explain what you did to meet the assignment's criteria. Use the criteria as headings to structure your reflection.

## How do your procedures address the needs of a "reading to learn to do audience"? Provide some specific examples that connect back to Redish's noted features of such an audience.

Reading to learn to do was a central part of my procedures because I was operating from an angle of using a room’s tools in three different contexts, as opposed to operating one piece of machinery three different ways. The goal is for the user to understand the steps we create in the procedures so that those tasks then become skills they can utilize in their lives. This meant orienting my steps and clarifying information, remaining focused not just on how users move from step to step, but anticipating how they might be feeling when something goes wrong. For example, my presentation procedure emphasized not to stress and when to ask for help to anticipate feelings of stress and frustration if problems occur. In addition, since professors might be arriving from different parts of campus, the average amount of time it takes to complete setting up and resetting the space allows them to account for extra time prior to their event.

## How do your procedures follow the WTGA Staging, Coaching, and Alerting stylistic conventions? Provide some specific examples that connect back to the criteria from Hart-Davidson.

I made use of staging, coaching, and alerting moves a lot in my student gaming procedure when discussing how to disconnect consoles from the OLED screen. Disconnecting was where there was a point of potential failure, because if the user forgot to save their game before disconnecting, their progress would be completely wiped, ruining their experience using the space for wellness. I established an alerting move for this, emphasizing the importance of saving game progress before moving forward with disconnecting from the screen.

## How do your procedures follow your task orientation work? In other words, based on your audience and their goals, discuss how you oriented your SCA moves to the tasks.

My procedures followed the task orientation work by making sure there were key differences to my procedure based on the scenarios I was working from. Since I was working in a specific place as my guiding point, the differences in the tasks stem from the contexts and the scenarios in the space. For example, the device connection sections of my guides focus on three different use cases: phones, laptops, and consoles. Each of these has similar steps, but the backgrounds of the people using the OLED screens in these situations are vastly different, and their backgrounds differ as well. For example, A student connecting a Nintendo Switch needs to have different connection, progress save, and disconnection information than someone connecting their phone. 


## How did you apply a basic docs-as-code editorial workflow to your assignment? Please provide specific cases with screenshots and/or links that can support your claims.

One of the biggest challenges I experienced with docs-as-code turned into one of my biggest motivations and points of growth in the project. Lately, I have been extremely scattered, foggy, and overwhelmed with the long list of tasks needed to complete the procedures. Working with commits in version control, articulating the changes I made, and seeing my own workflow through these commit snapshots helped me stay connected with the procedure criteria from start to finish. For example, in my student gaming scenario for the landing, I experienced issues with my images not uploading properly after pushing the origin to my branch. During that time, I was feeling defeated, but looking back, it is rewarding to witness the different phases of my troubleshooting and following my own problem-solving from start to finish.

## How did you apply a consistent use of the Markdown language throughout your project? Please provide specific cases with screenshots and/or links that can support your claims.

I used consistent markdown language by using a combination of headers, bulleted lists, and numbered list throughout my steps and moves. I primarily worked in each respective branch to develop the text for the steps. However, one of the problems I faced was drafting text formatting for the staging moves and the background information. One of my solutions was to spend some time with only VSCode up on my laptop without preview mode on, so my eyes could get used to the new interface. However, sometimes I was not happy with how things were articulated, so I would paste what I had into Google Docs to work through formatting in special cases in a more familiar interface. This was how I found out that Google Docs is markdown-friendly, so I was able to successfully use a familiar interface to draw connections to a system I have a rudimentary understanding of markdown language. My favorite tool to reference in creating the procedures was the [Markdown Language Cheat Sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) for when I was troubleshooting images and embedding hyperlinks.
