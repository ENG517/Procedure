# Procedure Ideation

The goal of this assignment is to develop a plan for 3-4 procedures carried out in the same context of work. For example, recall how Bellamy et al. use the running example about the Espresso machine. One could consider how the use of this machine will involve numerous types of user scenarios and goals with their own set of tasks. In sum, your ideation work should consider multiple scenarios with connected goals/technologies.

This document guides you through a series of heuristics, i.e., a set of guiding prompts and questions, to consider the details of the scenarios, goals, and tasks that will inform your writing.

Copy this document to your Google Drive. Then, follow the instructions within each section. When you have completed it, submit a **PDF version of it to Moodle.**

# Analyzing Your Audience

In this section, follow the guiding prompts to gather up a sense about your intended audience. Typically, you should conduct user research to qualify and verify such information. But, for the purposes of this exercise, it is fine if you rely more on your particular subjectivities. The point is to craft a more defined understanding of the audience.

## Exigence: What is the occasion for these procedural instructions? 

* Why are these procedural instructions necessary at this particular time and place? What issues/problems do these instructions aim to address?

These procedural instructions are necessary because The Landing at Hunt Library lacks the documentation for incoming users to understand how to use the space to organize wellness events for students on campus. 

* Why is this issue important right now? What is at stake, and for whom?

This issue is important amid mental health crises for university students, especially with NC State’s recent mental health crisis spike a couple of years ago. Providing space for more wellness-focused events at the library will community engagement and facilitate and increase in library space use. 

## Who is the audience? 

Highlight some of the characteristics that you think might apply to the projected audience:

* Potential user (someone who's exploring the product)  
* New user (someone who's getting started with the product)  
* Intermediate user (someone who has used the product before)  
* Experienced user (someone who's well-versed with the product)  
* New professional (someone who is new to the field and probably new to your product)  
* Experienced professional (someone who is an expert in the field but might be new to your product)  
* Admin/Leadership  
* New contributor  
* Experienced contributor  
* Other: \[Consider a more specific actor with a more specific role to the context of your procedure. For example, a software developer, if the procedure concerned some tool/feature for developers.\]

## What are the audience’s goals for these procedures? Develop 4 goals that all share the same context of activity with each other. Here are some examples to follow: 4 goals pertaining to making espresso drinks; 4 goals when playing Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom game; or 4 goals to improve one’s basketball skills.

Answer: 4 goals pertaining to using The Landing

## What situations and reasons might have brought the readers to your document(s)? 

Answer:  (1) A potential event organizer interested in utilizing the space for a wellness event with sensory needs (2) an incoming head of a club or university organization who wants to understand the touchscreen interface for the big screen (3) a lower-stakes mock dissertation defense practice or a small-scale class presentation 

## How might have they come to find your document? 

Answer: The document would be found online, likely as a .pdf sent during email correspondence for project planning and organization, with a laminated version kept in the space for use. 

## What information do they already have about the product/feature? 

Answer: The Landing’s location on Centennial campus in Hunt Library, its large screen with capabilities to hook up multiple consoles to them, a variety of comfy chairs and tabled seating for a variety of wellness event needs, 

## What are the main questions readers are likely to have? 

Answer: (1) How do they configure the screen for their needs (2) how do they connect laptops to the screen (3) how do they connect laptops to the screen (4) how do they orient the space once the event has concluded

# Write Your User Scenarios

Based on the above information, write 4 scenarios that include the 4 main parts of information: Who, Motivation(s), Goal, and Important Characteristics.

You may not write a procedure for all of the scenarios in the end, but this will help you gather a sense of how many procedures you will need to write for the major assignment.

IMPORTANT: All of your scenarios should be within the same context of activity or tool use. In other words, don’t write up 4 scenarios from 4 completely different contexts of activity. Here are some examples to follow: 4 scenarios pertaining to making espresso drinks; 4 scenarios when playing Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom game; or 4 scenarios to improve one’s basketball skills.

# 4 Scenarios pertaining to utilising The Landing as a wellness space

**Scenario 1**:   
	Who: a club event organizer who runs campus organizations for neurodivergent students  
Motivations: understanding the basics of the space to run a wellness event without trouble while creating a sensory-safe event for club members.  
	Goal: learn how the screen interface works to create a private, quiet space for a curated event  
Important Characteristics: Their biggest priorities are dimming the lights and windows to minimize harsh lighting and sound in the space so that they can be flexible with the computers, consoles, and board games working in the space.   
**Scenario 2**:   
Who: A professor in their 50s  
	Motivations: wants to hold final presentations for their 12-person class in the Landing to create a   
	Goal: set up the space for slide presentations with the room oriented for maximized engagement.   
	Important Characteristics: This is a co-listed course for undergraduate and graduate students.   
**Scenario 3**:   
Who: A 3rd-year student who brought her Nintendo Switch to The Landing  
	Motivations: setting up a casual Mario Kart tournament for her and her friends  
	Goal: Hook up the Nintendo Switch to the screens  
Important Characteristics: This student has been to an event in the landing before, and knows that only event organizers are allowed to access the interface,  and can contact a librarian to log them in, but must log out of the system and connect their equipment on their own. 

**Scenario 4**:   
**Who**: A librarian in Hunt Library. Part of their job description is to remain on-site to assist with events in the landing, troubleshoot technical difficulties, and relay information to the Ask Us desk regarding tech issues and potential items they may need to rent out for the event.   
Motivations: support campus organizations in developing wellness programs catered to their respective communities.   
**Goal**: successfully support event organizers and users of the space by knowing the ins and outs of the equipment and layout of the room.   
**Important Characteristics:** This librarian has five years of experience using different console systems and laptops. He does not know how certain console systems work, but uses an Apple ecosystem for their work. This is not their first time being in the space, but it is their first time getting information on the detailed workings of the system. 

# Analyzing Your Audience(s) Tasks

Complete one of the following tables to analyze the tasks that you will write for each user scenario. A task analysis will help you develop a better understanding of the following questions:

* How much supporting reference and conceptual information to provide  
* What level of “completeness” (low, mid, high) may you need to write the steps 

Remember that this is meant to be an ideation exercise—not a finished draft of the actual procedure. Yet, it should help you develop an initial rough draft.

Refer to Bellamy et al.’s discussion and example of a task analysis in Chapter 1 for support, as you move through this analysis work.

## 

## Task Analysis for Scenario 1

| Guiding Question | Details |
| ----- | ----- |
| What is the user-oriented goal?  Do not fall into the function/feature-oriented goal. | The user’s goal is to effectively use the basics of the electronics within The Landing while understanding the basics of the space’s resources at their disposal for the duration of their use of the space. The priority for this will be to understand the interface and the locations of the ports for this specific scenario |
| What tasks does the user need to perform to accomplish the goal?  Remember tasks are not the same as goals, and tasks are not synonymous with steps. Steps are the more specific actions needed to complete a larger “high-level” task. Don’t worry about sequence or the “completeness” yet. | Interface tasks Turn on the control screen Log in to the interface Turn on the big screen Change the audio for the speakers Environmental Tasks Brighten and dim the lights Toggle the glass window privacy screens Final tasks Return area to preset settings Log out of the system  |
| What are the mental and physical steps involved in each task? | **Mental**: interact with an unknown piece of technology. This can be a stressor for a new event organizer working with an interface unknown to them, and requires them to trust that they can work within the screen without fear of breaking anything in the system **Physical**: walk into the space, press buttons on the interface screen, register visual changes in the screen, windows, and lighting; hear changes in the master audio |
| Who performs the task? | **Audience**: club members they oversee **Experience**: knows how to run an event to meet the sensory needs of their members, but does not know how to use the technology in the space **Role**: superior to other organization members in that they are the one in contact with the librarian for any issues that arise.  **Authority**: login privileges granted by the observing librarian |
| When and under what conditions is the task performed? | **Requirements**: Registered to rent the space for a set time, which requires  **Limitations**: The organizers can only have access during the time they have the space rented out for **Environment**: enclosed room, the lights will be dark, but the location of the interface, ports, and screen are visible and will be reiterated in the guide |
| What are the potential distractions to accomplishing the goal? | **Alternative path**: brute force of poking around the tabs and messing with the settings to figure it out through trial and error, this could result in certain functions stopping working or an increase in visual delay from connected technologies and the screen.  **Exception path**: flipping between privacy mode and transparent mode in the glass too quickly, too many times, and disconnecting them from the interface entirely. **Boundaries**: finding the balance between a guided use of the system and “playing” with the features to the point of failure.  |
| What does the user need to know about the task? | **Duration**: it takes about 15 minutes to fully understand the technological capabilities of the space and program the area to meet the sensory needs of students in the space **Complexity**: minimal complexity, the user guide will serve as an explanation of what the settings do in the interface, so the organizer can curate their needs for the event based on the tools at their disposal **Frequency**: only working with it at the start for the most part, the most likely reason to return to the master interface is to change the master audio or lighting for the space, and to return to log out and return to preset settings at the end of their time |
| What is the sequence of tasks or steps? | Interface tasks Turn on the control screen Log in to the interface Turn on the big screen Change the audio for the speakers Environmental Tasks Brighten and dim the lights Toggle the glass window privacy screens Final tasks Return area to preset settings Log out of the system  |
| What is the expected result? | The expected result is successfully operating the interface for the organizer’s needs and run the event with minimal to no issues.  |

## Task Analysis for Scenario 2

| Guiding Question | Details |
| ----- | ----- |
| What is the user-oriented goal? | The professor’s goal is to set up the space for a final presentation day, which requires an understanding of the interface to connect a MacBook laptop into the system to screencast PowerPoint for students. |
| What tasks does the user need to perform to accomplish the goal?  (*Don’t worry about sequence or the “completeness” yet.*) | Log in to the interface Turn on the big screen Connect the laptop to the HDMI port Reset the MacBook Screencast the presentations |
| What are the mental and physical steps involved in each task? | **Mental**: connecting the Apple ecosystem requires resetting the connected technology a couple of times to get both systems to acknowledge the pairing and begin screencasting **Physical**: back and forth between the interface and the connected laptop to reset and check on connectivity status |
| Who performs the task? | **Audience**: Their students **Experience**: expert experience in the content being presented, virtually no experience using the space, let alone screencasting from start to finish on their own.  **Role**: Highly educated and knowledgeable user, just needs to be equipped with the means to learn.  **Authority**: login access privileges granted by the observing librarian to minimize distractions during presentations.  |
| When and under what conditions is the task performed? | **Requirements**: MacBook laptop and the proper adapter for the HDMI port, also a charger that can fit into an outlet to ensure the laptop doing the screencasting stays charged **Limitations**: This scenario highlights how to connect Mac systems to the screen in The Landing because they have the most issues in connecting without guided assistance, so this would not be of much use to someone with a Windows laptop.  **Environment**: User will be completing this setup on their own using the guide; however, librarians in charge of the space are on standby in the building to come downstairs and help with setup if the user encounters an error.  |
| What are the potential distractions to accomplishing the goal? | **Alternative path**: not understanding the system, trying to connect to the wrong port, needing to ask for help from students in the hall, and leaving the experience feeling stupid for not being able to keep up with technology.  **Exception path**: (1) not getting the reset process to work properly and resulting in the cast not working, (2) the computer dying mid-screencast, which would result in the entire process starting over once the laptop gains enough charge **Boundaries**: The steps must guide equipping them with tools for the space. Libraries are for learning, and no guide in there should take on a condescending tone.  |
| What does the user need to know about the task? | **Duration**: Pairing takes about 5 minutes, given that  resetting the MacBook while plugged into the adapter works **Complexity**: moderate complexity, connecting Apple ecosystems to the system requires some guided trial-and-error **Frequency**: This is the only time during the semester they will do this, however, if all goes well, it could become the go-to space for final presentations in future course sections. |
| What is the sequence of tasks or steps? | Log in to the interface Turn on the screen Plug the computer into the system using an HDMI adapter Reset the Apple product while plugged into the system |
| What is the expected result? | A seamless screencast onto the main screen in The Landing that results in  |

## 

## Task Analysis for Scenario 3

| Guiding Question | Details |
| ----- | ----- |
| What is the user-oriented goal? | The user’s goal is to connect their gaming console (Nintendo Switch) to the screen and successfully play a multiplayer game on it (Mario Kart) |
| What tasks does the user need to perform to accomplish the goal?  (*Don’t worry about sequence or the “completeness” yet.*) | Get logged into the system (librarian assistance) Turn on the screen Connect the gaming system to the screen Test the successful pairing of screencasting Connect all remotes to the game Play games without problems Unplug the system Log out of the interface |
| What are the mental and physical steps involved in each task? | **Mental**: less mental load will happen from the user not being the person connecting to the system, but will still have to successfully pair their console to the screen unassisted, without compromising The Landing’s or the console’s usability **Physical**: bending down to plug into the system, the ability to press buttons on a touch screen.  |
| Who performs the task? | **Audience**: Their peers (other students) **Experience**: Moderate understanding of their console, with a basic to no understanding of The Landing’s tech operations **Role**: basic user in need of assistance connecting to the system **Authority**: no admin privileges, but maintains autonomy on the personal device they input into the system |
| When and under what conditions is the task performed? | **Requirements**: librarian approval and oversight (for logging in since this is a student and not an event organizer or the head of an organization with affiliation to NCSU) **Limitations**: if logged out, the student will not know the password, and must recieve assistance getting back in the system for security and privacy purposes **Environment**: The overall space features and layout are constant across scenarios, but for a student, their use of the space depends on librarian assistance, which adds a surveillance variable that other scenarios might not.  |
| What are the potential distractions to accomplishing the goal? | **Alternative path**: the student somehow gets ahold of the interface password and connects to the screen through trial-and-error **Exception path**: They mistake the steps for consoles and MacBooks being the same, and accidentally factory reset their console and all its data **Boundaries**: emphasis on librarian approval will be necessary here, as the only other option would be to lock the space, which defeats the purpose ot aligning with the space’s motivation of being a wellness resource for students, employees, and instructors.  |
| What does the user need to know about the task? | **Duration**: 5 minutes tops, as long as you follow the steps **Complexity**: minimal complexity because the consoles do not need to be reset in order to get both systems to recognize the pairing **Frequency**: The steps only need to be completed once for the setup to occur |
| What is the sequence of tasks or steps? |  Ask for the librarian's permission to connect the console to the space  Get logged into the system (librarian assistance) Turn on the screen Connect the gaming system to the screen Test the successful pairing of screencasting Connect all remotes to the game Play games without problems Unplug the system Log out of the interface |
| What is the expected result? | Pairing the console to the big screen and successfully running a multiplayer game.  |

## 

## Task Analysis for Scenario 4

| Guiding Question | Details |
| ----- | ----- |
| What is the user-oriented goal? | This user’s goal is to have an understanding of The Landing’s layout and technological capabilities to support event organizers in running the space, alter the orientation of the tables and chairs, and fully reset the room to its original look at the end of the program.  |
| What tasks does the user need to perform to accomplish the goal?  (*Don’t worry about sequence or the “completeness” yet.*) | Log in to the interface Test the interface, screens, and systems Ensure the sound system functions Ensure the privacy screen is functional Ensure the lighting is programmed as intended Remain in contact with organizers in case of issues with technology |
| What are the mental and physical steps involved in each task? | **Mental**: More mental load is placed on the librarian or library specialist because they are the first point of contact for issues in the space, whether that be the lights flickering or the tables breaking.  **Physical**: move chairs, bend down to check HDMI inputs, visual, auditory, and spatial recognition, and understanding of typical lighting, sound, and privacy screen operations |
| Who performs the task? | **Audience**: the librarian’s audience would be the event organizers they assist for their duration in the space **Experience**: 5 years of experience in library sciences with a casual understanding of related systems to the Landing **Role**: specialist, the “crutch” if something goes wrong **Authority**: expert in space operations, the first point of contact for issues, liaison between event organizers and other library departments, should their assistance be needed.  |
| When and under what conditions is the task performed? | **Requirements**: This requires the librarian to be working during the event’s operation **Limitations**: Events held during normal workday hours of 9-5, there is also a slight buffer between  **Environment**: Once again, the environment is a constant; however, the librarians typically remain upstairs with their laptops close by should the organizers need their help. Remaining in the building is key to swift and effective problem diagnosis and treatment.  |
| What are the potential distractions to accomplishing the goal? | **Alternative path**: Assuming the guide is being ignored, the librarian would improvise solutions based on their experience using different systems or call IT if problems exceeded trial-and-error capabilities **Exception path**: If IT is not called, and brute-forcing occurs for the  **Boundaries**: |
| What does the user need to know about the task? | **Duration**: events can run from 1-3 hours, depending on the caliber; however, setup and resetting take 20 minutes each **Complexity**: moderate to advanced complexity \- librarians would use this guide to understand the full scope of the space’s capabilities and fall back on it for basic troubleshooting. This highlights that if the interface or systems behave in specific ways, an alerting move would be needed to highlight whether the solution can be reached with the librarian’s assistance or if IT should look at it to prevent further harm.  **Frequency**: every event, which happens a few times a week.  |
| What is the sequence of tasks or steps? | Log into the interface Test the interface, screens, and systems Ensure the sound system functions Ensure the privacy screen is functional Ensure the lighting is programmed as intended Remain in contact with organizers in case of issues with technology Troubleshoot issues as they occur Return to The Landing at the event’s conclusion Log out of the system if the organizers did not do so Reset the space to its original condition if organizers did not already do so.  |
| What is the expected result? | The end result is a successfully executed wellness event in the space with any technology issues being handled swiftly and effectively.  |
