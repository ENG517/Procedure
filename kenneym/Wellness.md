Welcome to the Landing; your place for promoting wellness and connection for students and faculty! We look forward to hosting your wellness events in the space.

### 2. Contact with a Librarian

## Resetting the Room 
It is important we maintain the space after events so the Landing remains a community resource 24 hours a day. Once your event concludes, we ask that you tidy up the space so it is ready for students to use it. 

Below is a checklist to help simplify the cleanup process after your event:

* Remove all snacks, drinks, and trash from the area.
* Push all chairs back under the tables.
* Unplug and return all equipment checked out from the library to the AskUs Desk. 

A librarian will check in after your event concludes to make sure the card games make it onto the OLED shelves and check for broken equipment. If we find any forgotten equipment, we will email you with a list and send it to the AskUs desk for you to pick up at a later time. If you forgot anything at the Landing, please message your librarian. For more information, please see the [NC State Libraries Lost and Found Polices.](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/borrow/lost)

That's it! You have successfully run an event in the Landing. Thank you for choosing NC State Libraries for hosting your wellness experience. We hope to work with you again soon!
