# How to Connect Techology to the OLED Display

**Goal:** Set up and reset the room when using the Landing outside of reservation times. 

A common misconception is the Landing can only be used when it is reserved. This is not true! You are free to use the space to play games, connect to the screen, and relax during your study break! This guide will teach you how to connect consoles to the OLED screen and use the space outside of its reservation times. 

## Before you Connect
1. Check the Events panel directly outside the Landing to see if the space is reserved.

    Below shows what the panel looks like and how reservations appear on the screen. A librarian will enter the space prior to a reservation time and kindly ask you to leave if you are there during those times. Plan to leave 15 minutes before an event to give yourself and the librarians enough time to tidy up the room. 

2. Find a librarian or someone at the Ask Us deak to log you into the system

    The library does not share the OLED password with students, so if you would like to use the screen, ask someone to log you in first. 

## Materials
* HDMI cable
* HDMI adapter (optional)
* Your personal console

Tip: if you don't have something, visit the AskUs desk to rent it for the afternoon. For more information on tech lending options for your needs, please visit [the tech lending portal.](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/devices)
## Connecting your consoles: 
1. Locate HDMI Input 1 underneath the OLED screen
2. Insert the HDMI cable into the port
3. Connect your equipment to the cord
Your device name should now appear on the OLED interface panel. If your equipment's inputs do not match your cable, it will not appear. You will need an *HDMI adapter* to fix this as noted in materials.
4. Tap on the device name in the OLED interface and press "accept connection"

Your device's screen should now be casting on the OLED display. 

## Troubleshooting Console Device Audio
Sometimes the audio will not automatically play when connected to the screen. This is caused by 3 different issues
### 1. Your device audio is muted
On the interface panel, turn the speaker volume to 50%

Go to your device settings and check if your console is muted. 

This will look different for different consoles. If you have trouble locating your device's audio settings, please visit the AskUs desk for assistance.


The volume should now output through the speakers. If the try troubleshooting by checking device priority on the speakers. 

### 2. Your device is not recieving priority in the speakers 

If more than one console is connected to the screen, the newest connection will output audio to the screen. All others will not output to the OLED speakers. If a different console should be outputting audio, disconnect the device you want sound for and repear steps 2-4.


## Disconnecting Your Consoles
Before disconnecting your device, make sure your progress is saved on all consoles. 

1. Return to your device's home screen.
Power off Device
Remove the HDMI cable from the OLED input

This should result in a black square appearing on the OLED screen in place if your device screencasting. This means you successfully disconnected your console and it is safe to remove the cord from your device. After 30 seconds, the black screen will disappear on its own. 

Remove the HDMI cable from your device


 **WARNING:** If you disconnect your console from the cord before the HDMI input, your console's homepage will freeze on the screen. If this happens, navigate to the interface panel, and exit the input tab. This will remove the frozen screencast from the OLED and successfully return the screen to its origional backdrop. 



## Resetting the room
1. To log out of the OLED panel, press and hold the top left corner of the screen. 
2. Roll all chairs back under the tables you found them. 
3. Remove all personal items from the space when you leave. 
4. Return checked out materials to the AskUs Desk
