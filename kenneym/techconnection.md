# How to Connect Techology to the OLED Display

This guide will teach you how to _. 
## Before you Connect
1. Check the Events panel directly outside the Landing to see if the space is reserved.

    Below shows what the panel looks like and how reservations appear on the screen. A librarian will enter the space prior to a reservation time and kindly ask you to leave if you are there during those times. 

2. Find a librarian or someone at the Ask Us deak to log you into the system

    The library does not share the OLED password with students, so if you would like to use the screen, ask someone to log you in first. 

## Materials

Note: if you don't have something, head to the AskUs desk to rent it for the afternoon. For more information on tech lending options for your needs, please visit [the tech lending portal.](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/devices)
## Connecting your consoles: 
Locate HDMI Input 1 underneath the OLED screen
2. Insert the HDMI cable into the port
3. Connect your equipment to the cord
note: if your equipment's inputs do not match your cable, you may need an adapter as noted in materials.
